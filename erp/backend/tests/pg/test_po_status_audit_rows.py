"""Purchase-order FSM transitions must leave an ActivityLog row (PG lane only).

The same defect the invoice tests next door cover, in two more places and with a
worse failure mode. ``approve_po`` and ``issue_po`` read ``po.po_number`` for
the audit metadata AFTER ``PORepository.update``, which ends in
``session.expire_all()``. Reading an expired attribute on the async session
re-issues a sync SELECT and raises ``MissingGreenlet``. The audit call is
wrapped in a ``try/except`` so the status change survives, and the except arm
logged at DEBUG, which is below the production root level of INFO. Every PO
approved and every PO issued therefore lost its compliance row leaving nothing
at all behind, not even a warning.

The linter cannot help here: ``F841`` (local assigned but never used) is in this
repository's ruff ignore list, so a snapshot taken and then not used is silent.
The invoice fix was itself half-applied for exactly that reason - the local was
added, the read below it was left alone, and both ruff and a reviewer signed it
off. A test that asserts on the persisted row is the only thing that notices.

These assert on the row rather than on log output, so they cannot pass because
somebody reworded a message and cannot keep passing if the row is written with
the wrong contents.
