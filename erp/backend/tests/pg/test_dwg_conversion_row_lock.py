"""A DWG conversion must not hold the drawing row while it runs.

Issue #409 reported a 22 MB DWG whose conversion failed, and then three
things that look like separate problems and are not:

    Request timeout after 45000ms: PATCH /v1/dwg_takeoff/drawings/<id>/scale/

the drawing could not be deleted afterwards, and a second upload elsewhere in
the application failed to reach the server at all. One cause covers all of it.
The background conversion marked the drawing ``processing`` and then ran for
minutes before its session committed, so PostgreSQL held a row lock on that
drawing for the whole conversion and every other write to the same row queued
behind it until the client gave up at 45 seconds.

These tests need two real connections to the same database, which is why they
live in the PostgreSQL lane rather than the shared savepoint fixture: a lock is
only observable between separate transactions.
