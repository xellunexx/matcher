"""PG: schedule activities list in code order, not in text order (internal #167).

``ActivityRepository.list_for_schedule`` ordered by ``sort_order`` then
``wbs_code``. ``wbs_code`` is a ``String(50)``, so the second term compared
text: ``"10"`` sorted before ``"2"``. That only bites when the first term
fails to separate the rows - and it separates nothing at all in a schedule
whose rows carry the column's default of 0, which is exactly what the demo
seeder writes (it never passes ``sort_order``). A 35-activity programme
therefore listed as 1, 10, 11 ... 19, 2, 20 ...

The order has to be settled in SQL because the read is paginated: sorting a
page after it arrives only rearranges that page, so the list looks fixed on
page one and is still wrong at the boundary.
:func:`test_natural_order_holds_across_a_pagination_boundary` is the test
that would have caught a client-side "fix".

Real PostgreSQL because the sort key is a ``regexp_replace`` pair evaluated
by the database, and an ORM-level assertion could not observe it.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
