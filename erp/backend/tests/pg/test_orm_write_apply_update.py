"""PG contract tests for ``app.core.orm_write.apply_update``.

This helper replaces ``session.expire_all()`` at every bulk-UPDATE site in the
platform, so a mistake in it is not one broken endpoint but stale reads
everywhere at once. That reach is the whole reason it lives in core with its
own gate rather than being copied into each repository.

Why this lane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``tests/pg`` is the only suite the *CI (PostgreSQL)* workflow runs and so the
only place a test can block a merge. It also has to be this lane specifically:
the failure being guarded against, ``MissingGreenlet``, is an asyncpg
behaviour. SQLite tolerated the lazy load that raises here, so a SQLite run
would report success on exactly the code this exists to reject.

The crm models are borrowed as a convenient pair of mapped classes; nothing
here is about crm.
