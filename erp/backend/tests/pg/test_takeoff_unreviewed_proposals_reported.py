"""PG: the estimate says how much takeoff work it left out.

Excluding unreviewed proposals from priced quantities is correct and already
pinned by ``test_takeoff_proposals_excluded_from_quantities``. What that
exclusion creates is a silence: a user who ran plan reading, never worked the
review queue and then priced the project sees a total that is short of what the
drawing shows, with nothing to explain the difference.

``ai_takeoff.unreviewed_proposals`` fills that silence. These tests pin the two
halves that have to line up for it to mean anything: the repository counting the
right rows, and the rule reading a count it is actually given. The rule is a
WARNING and not an ERROR on purpose - the estimator refuses to apply a run whose
report carries errors, and pricing the confirmed subset is a legitimate thing to
want.

Real PostgreSQL because the count is aggregation SQL over an enum-ish column.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
