"""Websocket handshake guard for the app-wide RLS dependency.

Regression cover for the defect that shipped in 12.3 through 12.6: both
realtime sockets (live notifications and collaboration presence) answered every
handshake with a 500. ``rls_request_context`` is mounted as a global dependency
in :mod:`app.main` and resolves the caller through the optional-user chain. That
chain used to read the bearer token with ``HTTPBearer``, whose ``__call__`` is
typed for ``Request`` and raises on a websocket scope, so the dependency solver
failed before any route body ran. Nothing about the route code was wrong, which
is why it survived four releases.

These tests mount the real global dependency on a throwaway websocket route. No
cluster and no database are needed: an anonymous handshake resolves to
``tenant_id=None`` and short-circuits before the first query. The file lives in
the PG lane because that lane is what *CI (PostgreSQL)* gates, and because the
dependency under test is the multi-tenant RLS plumbing. The lane's cluster
fixture is opt-in, so nothing here pays for an ``initdb``.
