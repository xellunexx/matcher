"""PG: the Project-Files -> takeoff document link.

Opening a PDF from the /files area must land on a REAL ``TakeoffDocument``
rather than on the ``oe_documents_document`` id, because every takeoff artefact
(measurements, page scales, extracted text, AI runs) keys on the takeoff id.
The bridge is ``TakeoffDocument.source_document_id`` plus the find-or-create in
``TakeoffService.get_or_create_takeoff_from_source``.

These tests run against a REAL PostgreSQL cluster because the properties worth
pinning are all database-level and cannot be observed on the mock-repository
suite in ``tests/modules/takeoff/test_from_source.py``:

* the ``uq_takeoff_document_project_source`` unique index is what actually
  stops a concurrent double-open from minting two rows (#369) - the mock
  implements find-or-create in Python and stays green with the index dropped;
* that index is deliberately plain rather than partial, which only works
  because PostgreSQL treats NULLs as distinct - SQLite would not prove it;
* deleting the source document is a cross-module interaction between
  ``DocumentService`` and the takeoff tables.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).

    readable. The reference goes stale, which the next open handles as a clean
    404 (pinned separately below) rather than a 500.

    DECISION RECORD - this test pins CURRENT behaviour, deliberately, and the
    behaviour depends on a known defect. The takeoff document survives the
    delete precisely *because* the from-source path copies the PDF bytes into
