"""PG: an unreviewed detector proposal is never counted as a quantity.

Proposals became durable rows in the takeoff table, which means every read
path that used to see only hand-drawn work now sees suggestions too. That is
fine on the canvas, where they render translucent and dashed, and wrong
everywhere a number is totalled, exported or priced: nobody has agreed to a
proposal yet, and a rejected row is a record of a decision, not a measurement.

These tests pin the boundary on the paths where the number reaches a person:
the project summary, the CSV export, the AI estimator's element extraction and
the project dashboard tile. The estimator is the sharpest of the four - it
turns each row into a priced element, so a leak there invents money.

``review_status`` defaults to ``'confirmed'`` in the column, so the guard is an
allowlist and pre-existing rows are unaffected. Real PostgreSQL because the
predicate rides along with the aggregation SQL.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
