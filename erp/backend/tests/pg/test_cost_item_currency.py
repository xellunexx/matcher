"""A cost item may not be stored without the currency its region names.

The authoritative signal is the region tag. A CWICR catalogue is imported one
region at a time and every rate inside it is denominated in that region's local
currency, so ``oe_costs_item.region`` states which money the rate is in even
though the source parquet carries no currency column. That is why
:data:`app.modules.costs.region_currency.REGION_CURRENCY` is keyed by region and
why an importer can stamp a whole file from a single lookup.

Measured on a real install before these tests were written: 55 718 of 123 485
cost rows carried an empty currency, every one of them ``source = 'cwicr'`` and
``region = 'ZH_SHANGHAI'``. Not one row of the other three regions in the same
table was affected. The cause was two tables that were supposed to say the same
thing: the loader takes the bases it will accept from ``base_registry``, while
the currency lookup was built from the v3 snapshot registry, and twelve of the
thirty-eight loadable regions were absent from it. ``ZH_SHANGHAI`` was one, so
its import resolved to ``""`` and wrote a catalogue of prices with no unit of
money on them.

These tests read the stored column, never a response schema. Three separate
read paths already fill a blank currency from the region on the way out (the
``CostItemResponse`` validator, ``_resolve_currency`` in the router, and the
matcher), so a test that creates an item and reads it back through the API
layer stays green with every write path broken. The assertions below re-query
the column with a fresh ``select()`` for the same reason ``session.get()`` is
avoided: the identity map would hand back the object still in memory rather
than what the database holds.
