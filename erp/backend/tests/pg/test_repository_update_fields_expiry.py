"""PG contract tests for the shared ``_update_fields`` repository helper.

``crm.repository._update_fields`` is one module-level function serving eight
repository classes, and ``webhook_leads`` carries its own copy of the same
shape. That reach is why it needs a gate: a mistake here is not a crash in one
endpoint, it is stale reads across a module.

Why this lane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Neither module has any test in ``tests/pg``, which is the only suite the
*CI (PostgreSQL)* workflow runs and therefore the only place a test can block a
merge. Their existing tests live in ``tests/unit``, ``tests/integration`` and
``tests/modules``, and ``tests/modules`` has no CI coverage at all. Without this
file a regression in the helper reaches main unchallenged.

What is actually being pinned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``session.expire_all()`` after an UPDATE is correct in the narrow sense - the
row did change and the identity map is stale. The damage is its blast radius:
it expires *every* object the session holds, including ones the caller is still
using. Under asyncio that is not merely a re-fetch, it is a synchronous lazy
load attempted from async code, which raises ``MissingGreenlet``. The targeted
form writes the known values straight onto the instance and expires only the
attributes whose new value was a SQL expression the database had to evaluate.
