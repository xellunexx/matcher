"""A frozen desktop build must refuse to pip-upgrade itself (issue #403).

The reporter clicked "Apply update" in the Windows app on 9.4.0 and got an
argparse usage dump ending ``invalid choice: 'pip'``. That output is this
application's own CLI answering: in the PyInstaller sidecar ``sys.executable``
is the frozen binary, so ``[sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", ...]``
re-enters the app instead of reaching an interpreter.

These tests need neither a database nor an authenticated client, but they live
in the PG lane because that is the lane CI actually runs. Their whole job is to
be present on the gate: the defect is invisible to every test that runs under a
normal interpreter, because under one ``sys.frozen`` is simply absent and the
guarded branch is never taken.
