"""``v3281_cases_module`` builds the same schema ``create_all`` builds.

The platform installs its schema two ways: ``Base.metadata.create_all`` on a
fresh install, and the alembic chain on an existing deployment. A new module
whose revision disagrees with its models produces two different databases that
both look installed, and only one of them serves the module.

So this runs the revision's own ``upgrade()`` against a real PostgreSQL and
compares the result to what the ORM metadata emits, rather than to what the
revision was written to say. The chain itself is not replayed - the single-head
and identifier-length checks cover that - because replaying 300-odd revisions
to reach this one would test everything except the thing that is new.
