"""A card must not say "0 components" about a recipe that has three.

The list query loads assemblies without their components on purpose, to keep a
page of fifty from dragging every component row across and to stay clear of a
lazy load in an async session. The response builder then read the length of that
collection, and an unloaded collection is indistinguishable from an empty one,
so every card in the list printed 0 while its own hover panel, which calls the
detail endpoint, listed the real three.

This is the loading policy's own example: noload does not raise, it returns an
empty collection, which is a silent wrong answer rather than an error. The count
now comes from a grouped COUNT. Both halves are asserted here, the count being
right and the collection still being empty, because a future change that fixes
the number by eagerly loading the components would pass the first assertion
while undoing the reason the query is shaped this way.
