"""A running conversion must not be declared dead, and reading must not write.

Issue #409. The orphan detector used to ask "has this taken too long?" and
treat the answer as "is the task that owns it gone?". Those are different
questions and elapsed time cannot separate them, because the work has no upper
bound to compare against: the DDC subprocess is capped, but the xlsx parse
after it has no timeout and its cost tracks the size of the drawing. Measured
on a 200,000 row export that parse alone took 86 seconds.

So a large drawing crossed the cutoff while converting normally, and was told
it was dead. The message it was given asked the user to delete the drawing and
upload it again, and deleting was the one operation blocked at that moment by
the conversion's own row lock. The advice on screen and the state of the
system were in direct contradiction.

These live in the PostgreSQL lane because that is the only lane that gates
anything, and because two of them need a second connection to prove that a
read really did leave the row alone.
