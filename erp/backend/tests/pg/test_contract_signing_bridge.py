"""Contracts put up for signature: the reference, the gate and the re-hash.

Everything here needs two modules' tables at once, which is why it is in the
PostgreSQL lane rather than beside the pure-function tests.

The reference. A signing session is filed under ``contract:{id}`` and nothing
else knows how to find it. If the reference the writer builds and the reference
the reader queries ever drift apart, every screen goes quietly empty rather than
failing, so the round trip is asserted through the service rather than assumed
from the constant.

The gate. Running the compliance gate at session initiation is the point of the
whole endpoint: the same gate also guards ``draft -> active``, but by then
everyone has signed. A test that only proved the transition is gated would pass
on a version where the initiation check was deleted.

There are two gates at initiation, and the second one is why these tests carry
a rule registration of their own. The schedule of values is checked by the
project's compliance packs; the contract itself - who is on the register, what
the template pin says - is checked by this module's own ``contracts`` rule set,
which a contract with nobody who signs fails. That rule set is registered from
the module package's startup hook, and a test process starts no application, so
without the fixture below the gate would find no rules and refuse everything as
uncheckable.

The re-hash. ``signing.delta_by_hash`` can only ever report a stale signature if
somebody pushes a new content hash when the paper changes, and the signing module
cannot do that because it has no way to look at a contract. So the duty sits on
``update_contract``, and this file is what proves the machinery can actually
fire. Delete the ``refresh_signing_content_hash`` call and only this test goes
red; every other check on both modules stays green while the staleness feature
is structurally dead.
