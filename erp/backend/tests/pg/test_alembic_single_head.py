"""The migration chain must have exactly one head.

A second head makes ``alembic upgrade head`` refuse to run at all, for
everyone, with "Multiple head revisions are present". It is not a degraded
mode: nobody can upgrade until it is repaired. It happened on main when a
module migration named a parent that a merge revision had already folded into
the mainline hundreds of revisions earlier, and it went unnoticed because our
own production deploy is ``create_all`` plus ``alembic stamp head`` and never
walks the chain. Only self-hosters upgrading in place would have hit it.

The revisions are read with ``ast`` rather than imported. Importing them means
importing ``app.database``, which requires a PostgreSQL URL and would make
this a slow test that needs a database to answer a question that is purely
about text on disk. It would also mean an unrelated import error anywhere in
the 300-plus revision files silently disables the check, which is exactly the
failure mode a guard must not have.
