"""The seeded service desk must not report a 100% SLA breach.

Every ticket the demo shipped had breached, which reads as a broken feature
rather than as a struggling contractor. Two independent causes:

* historical tickets carried a flat four-hour ``sla_due_at`` against a
  one-to-twenty-four-hour resolution, so roughly five in six breached by
  construction;
* open tickets were aged zero to seventy-two hours against a response window
  of fifteen to four hundred and eighty minutes, so nearly all of them were
  already overdue the moment they were written.

The distribution is a property of rows in a database, not of the generator's
return value, so it is checked here rather than beside the seeder. A unit test
over the draw function would pass even after the seeder stopped calling it.
See :data:`_BREACH_FLOOR` for why the bands are tight rather than generous.

#
# The margin is deliberately narrow. The seeder runs on ``random.Random(42)``,
# so these rates are not a sample, they are a fixed property of the code, and a
# wide band would buy no robustness at all - it would only leave room for a
# regression to hide in. The first version of this test allowed up to 35% and
# 30%, which caught the original all-red estate but would have passed a silent
# tripling of the breach rate.
#
# The intended consequence: changing ``_SLA_OUTCOME_MIX`` fails here. That is
# not friction to route around, it is the point. Anyone retuning the mix has to
# say what the demo estate should now look like, in this file, on purpose.
