"""A seeded letter must reach the database pointing at the contact it is with.

The unit tests next to the generator check that every letter names a role the
same demo seeds a contact for. They cannot check the step after that: the role
is turned into a contact id by the seeding writer, which mints the ids as it
writes and needs a session, so this is the only place the link is read back.

Two demos, because the writer chooses the contact list and the letter list
independently. office-frankfurt takes both from the generator. The Heilbronn
retail demo has a hand-curated contact list and no curated correspondence, so
it is seeded with curated contacts and generated letters, which is a pairing
the generator never produces on its own.
