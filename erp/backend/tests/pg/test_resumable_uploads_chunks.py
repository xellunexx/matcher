"""PG contract tests for ``resumable_uploads``: chunk order, replay, and integrity.

The module had zero coverage. Its entire reason to exist is surviving an
interrupted upload, so the tests concentrate on the paths an interruption
actually produces: chunks arriving out of order, a chunk replayed after a
dropped connection, a chunk that does not match the size the session
contracted for, a session resumed from a partial state, and the SHA-256 gate
that decides whether the assembled bytes are the file the client meant to send.

Why this lane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``tests/pg`` is the only suite the *CI (PostgreSQL)* workflow runs, so it is
the only place a test can block a merge. ``received_chunks`` is also a JSON
column read back as a list, which is a dialect behaviour worth exercising on a
real cluster.

Two seams keep this fast and hermetic:

* ``OE_CLI_DATA_DIR`` is redirected per test. ``chunk_store._resumable_base_dir``
  reads it at call time, so without this the tests would write into the
  developer's real ``~/.openestimator`` and leak chunks between runs.
* Sessions for the chunk/disk tests are constructed directly with a tiny
  ``chunk_size``. ``create_session`` cannot produce one - ``MIN_CHUNK_SIZE`` is
  256 KiB - and a suite that moved a quarter megabyte per chunk would be slow
  for no extra coverage. ``create_session`` is still exercised on its own for
  the bounds it enforces.
