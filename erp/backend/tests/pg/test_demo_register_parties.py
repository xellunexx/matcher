"""Four registers name a party in prose; each must also point at one.

Purchase orders, contracts, inspections and the punch list each have a column
for the contact they are about, and every one of them was left null. On screen
that is a vendor column of blanks, a contract register whose counterparty is
text, and a punch list reading Unassigned on all ten rows.

The ids are minted by the seeding writer as it goes, so a link can only be read
back from a database; the unit tests beside the generator can check that a seed
row names a role, not that the role became an id. That is what this file is for.

Both demos, because the writer picks the contact list and each register's rows
through separate fallbacks: office-frankfurt takes contacts from the generator,
retail-market-heilbronn has a hand-curated contact list, and a curated list can
hold a different set of roles than the generated one the registers assume.
