"""Seeded variation money must be in the currency its project budgets in.

``seed_variations_demo`` wrote EUR on every row regardless of the project, so a
Dubai project listed AED orders from the demo generator and EUR orders from the
seeder in one list, with no rate between them and a total above that added
them.

The unit tests next to this one reach only the generator, which took its
currency from the template before that was ever a question. The seeder writes
through the ORM and needs a session, so this is the only place the seven
corrected rows are actually read back.
