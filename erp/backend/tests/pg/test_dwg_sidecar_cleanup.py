"""The converter's intermediate spreadsheet must not outlive the conversion.

Issue #409. A DWG conversion writes a ``<name>_dwg.xlsx`` beside the upload,
reads the entities out of it, and left it there. On every path: the five error
branches, the success path, and drawing deletion. Nothing else ever reads it.

That matters in proportion to the drawing, which is the wrong way round. The
reporter's file was 22 MB, the spreadsheet a large drawing produces is larger
still, and a conversion that fails is the one people retry, so the copies pile
up fastest on the installation that just failed to convert something big.

Every test here asserts the file is present before the act that should remove
it. Asserting only its absence afterwards would pass just as well against a
test that never created it.
