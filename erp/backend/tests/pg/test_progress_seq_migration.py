"""PG: migration ``v3258_progress_entry_seq`` actually runs, and backfills in order.

Every "latest wins" query in the progress module now leads with ``seq``, so a
migration that fails, or that numbers historical rows in the wrong order, is not
a schema inconvenience - it silently changes which reading the page reports.

The tests below execute the real migration file against a real table holding
real rows. They do not re-implement its SQL: re-running the same UPDATE inside
the test body would measure the test's arithmetic twice and the migration zero
times.

Two properties matter and neither is visible from reading the file:

* the backfill follows ``recorded_at, created_at, id`` rather than physical row
  order, so the rows are seeded in a deliberately wrong physical order;
* the sequence restarts ABOVE the highest backfilled value, so the first row
  written after the migration does not collide at 1.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
