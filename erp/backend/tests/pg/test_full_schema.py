"""Full-schema smoke on embedded PostgreSQL.

The session-scoped ``pg_async_url`` fixture already builds the ENTIRE ORM schema
(every module's models) once per run via ``create_all`` on a real PG cluster — so
if any model emits PG-incompatible DDL the fixture setup raises and every PG test
errors. These tests turn that implicit build into explicit assertions: the schema
materialises, the JSON->JSONB ``@compiles`` + ``after_create`` index hooks fire,
and a handful of load-bearing tables are present.

This is the guard that stops PG-breaking DDL from shipping untested.
