"""Authored clause templates: the union, the freeze, and the pinned version.

Three things here can only be checked against a database, which is why this
file lives in the PostgreSQL lane rather than beside the pure-function tests.

The union. The catalogue a user picks from has two halves that are stored
completely differently: eleven built-in standard forms that are module
constants, and the tenant's own paper, which is rows. They meet in exactly one
method, ``ContractTemplateRepository.list_all``, and the invariant that matters
is that no code ever appears twice across the two. No unique index can enforce
that, because half the namespace is not in the database, so it is checked here.

The freeze. Publishing a version makes it immutable and the next edit opens
N+1. That is a rule about rows in two states plus a real unique constraint on
(code, version), and a stub cannot tell you whether the constraint exists.

The pin. A contract stores which template version it was drawn from, and has to
keep saying that after a later version is published. Testing it needs a
contract row, a template row and a second template row.
