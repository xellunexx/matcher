"""Cost Explorer candidate pool ordering on real PostgreSQL (PG lane only).

``CostExplorerRepository.search_work`` fetches a pool of candidates and cuts it
with ``LIMIT``; the service then re-ranks only what survived. So the cut decides
what an estimator can see, and it has to be reproducible.

It was not. The pool was ordered by concept-match count alone, and for a
one-word query every row that got past the WHERE matches exactly one concept, so
the sort key was a constant. PostgreSQL is then free to return whichever rows the
plan produced, and the same search run twice returned different work items at
different rates - a rate nobody could cite, because nobody could find it again.

These tests assert an EXPLICIT expected sequence rather than running the query
twice and comparing. Two runs in one session share a plan and an identity map,
so they can agree while the order is still undefined; only naming the rows in
advance pins it down.

PostgreSQL because the whole-word synonym branch uses ``~*``, which SQLite has
no operator for.
