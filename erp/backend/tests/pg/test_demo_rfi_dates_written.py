"""The date the seeder computes for an RFI has to be the date the row ends up with.

``created_at`` carries a Python-side ``default`` and a ``server_default``, so a
value passed to the constructor is one the ORM can yield on and the database can
overwrite. If either happened the row would be stamped at insert, which is the
exact bug the seeder fix was about, and every check that reads the helper as a
pure function would still pass: the unit tests never touch a session, and the
rest of the PG lane only proves the seeder does not raise. This file is the one
place the value is read back out of a database.

retail-market-heilbronn because that is the estate the RFI register was reported
on, and it seeds its RFIs from the generator rather than a curated list.
