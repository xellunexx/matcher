"""PG: an erased account leaves the user management list (issue #418).

Deleting a user anonymises the row in place rather than removing it. Projects
point at the user through ``owner_id`` and activity / audit rows through
``actor_id``, and the projects foreign key cascades, so a hard delete would take
the user's projects, BOQs and documents down with the account. The row survives,
stripped of every personal field and unable to authenticate.

What it must not do is stay on the management page. An administrator who deleted
a colleague kept seeing the account: no name, and an email reading
``deleted+<hash>@deleted.invalid``. It looks like a deletion that failed, and
deleting it again answers 404, because the erasure path refuses a row that is
already erased. So the list is what changes here, not the row.

The discriminating case is the suspended account. Erasure also flips
``is_active`` to False, so a filter written on ``is_active`` would satisfy the
two absence tests below and still be wrong: an account an administrator merely
suspended has to keep appearing under the inactive filter, which is the screen
they go to in order to reactivate it. That test passes both before and after the
fix on purpose - it is what pins the filter to ``deleted_at``.

Real PostgreSQL because the predicate has to reach the count subquery as well as
the page. Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
