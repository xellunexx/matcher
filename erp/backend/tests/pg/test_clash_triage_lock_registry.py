"""The per-subject triage lock registry must give its entries back.

``_subject_locks`` maps a clash id to an :class:`asyncio.Lock` so two callers
triaging the same clash in one process serialise and the second one hits the
cache instead of paying for another LLM call. The registry used to be
write-only: every subject ever triaged left an entry behind for the life of the
worker, which is a leak rather than a cache, because the entry is only useful
while somebody is actually inside it.

Nothing about this needs a database. It lives in the PG lane because that lane
is a merge gate and the default unit lane is only run by a job that is
chronically red for unrelated reasons, so a guard placed there is a guard
nobody reads.
