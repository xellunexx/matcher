"""The decision-impact engine and the service must agree on what is committed.

``decision_impact`` is deliberately a pure module: no ORM, no ``app.*`` imports,
stdlib and ``Decimal`` only. The price of that is a duplicated copy of the
committed-status vocabulary, and a duplicate nobody checks is a divergence
waiting to happen. It already happened once. The engine held a single set,
``{"approved", "executed"}``, and applied it to change orders and variation
orders alike. A variation order's FSM is ``issued -> in_progress -> completed |
voided`` and never passes through either word, so no variation order could ever
count. The decision-impact panel understated committed cost and days by the
whole value of every agreed VO, and the "resulting" figures inherited it.

These tests pin the two copies together and pin each copy to the FSM it claims
to describe, so the next divergence fails here instead of quietly shrinking a
number on a panel.

No database is involved. They live in the PG lane because that lane is a merge
gate and the default unit lane is only run by a job that is chronically red for
unrelated reasons.
