"""The migrator must restore missing constraints without ever failing a boot.

``postgres_auto_migrate`` runs at startup on every embedded and desktop install.
Adding constraint healing to it introduces a hazard that the column and index
healing never had: the databases missing a constraint are exactly the ones that
may hold rows violating it, because the constraint is what would have stopped
those rows being written. ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE`` against a
table holding duplicates raises, and an uncaught raise here does not degrade the
feature, it stops the application starting.

So the gate is not "the constraint came back". That passes trivially. The gate is
"a database that cannot take the constraint still boots", which is the test below
that plants duplicate rows on purpose.

The migrator opens and commits its own transaction, so these tests cannot be
wrapped in an outer rollback. Each one restores what it changed in a ``finally``.
