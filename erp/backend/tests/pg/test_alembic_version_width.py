"""Width of alembic's own version table on real PostgreSQL (issue #399).

The app's boot path creates ``alembic_version`` itself, through a bare
``MigrationContext`` that never loads ``alembic/env.py``. It therefore used to
get alembic's stock ``version_num VARCHAR(32)`` while the widening hook in
``env.py`` only ever reached databases created by alembic directly. 30 revision
ids in this tree are longer than 32 characters, so the next ``alembic upgrade
head`` that traversed one of them aborted with ``value too long for type
character varying(32)`` and the database could not move.

These tests live in the PG lane because the defect is PostgreSQL-only: SQLite
ignores a declared VARCHAR length, which is exactly why the bug survived the
default suite. They need a blank database rather than the lane's schema-loaded
fixture, so they provision throwaway ones on the session cluster and never
touch the shared schema.
