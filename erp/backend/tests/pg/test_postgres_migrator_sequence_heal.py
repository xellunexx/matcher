"""PG: the auto-migrator creates the sequence its own ADD COLUMN defaults from.

``oe_progress_entry.seq`` defaults from a named sequence. On a database created
before v3258 the column is absent, so the boot-time healer emits
``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN seq BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('oe_progress_entry_seq_seq')``
- and until this heal existed that statement failed with ``UndefinedTableError:
relation "oe_progress_entry_seq_seq" does not exist``, taking the two ``seq``
indexes and the unique constraint down with it. Every failure is logged at
WARNING and the boot continues, so the only symptom is that every read of the
progress module 500s afterwards: the ORM maps a column the table does not have.

``create_all`` runs immediately after the healer and does NOT repair this - the
sequence is column-attached, and ``create_all`` only emits column-attached
sequences from inside ``visit_table``, which it skips for a table that already
exists. The second test below holds that behaviour down, because it is what
makes the failure permanent rather than one boot long.

``test_progress_seq_migration.py`` cannot catch any of this: it drives the
Alembic migration, which creates its own sequence, so it exercises the one
schema-building path that was never broken.

Uses ``pg_engine`` rather than ``pg_session`` on purpose: the healer bounds every
DDL with ``SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '3s'``, so a test holding an open transaction
on ``oe_progress_entry`` would make it fail for a reason that has nothing to do
with sequences.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
