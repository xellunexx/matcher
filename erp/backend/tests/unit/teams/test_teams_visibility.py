"""Restriction semantics: what a visibility row does, and what it cannot do.

``EntityVisibility`` is subtractive. A record with no row is open to everyone
who can reach its project; a record with rows is open to the named teams, plus
the project owner and system admins. These cases pin both halves, and the
boundary between them.

The access-control negatives live in ``test_teams_access_control.py``. What is
here is the behaviour an operations lead configures: restrict, widen, lift,
and read back who is left.
