"""The access-control negatives for the teams module.

The invariant under test, stated once so every case below can be read against
it: **no arrangement of teams, memberships or restrictions may show a user a
project or a record they could not already reach.** The team layer narrows. It
never widens.

Three ways that invariant could be broken, and the case that closes each:

1. A low-privilege caller writes a membership row. ``verify_project_access``
   reads any membership row as project access, so writing one is equivalent to
   handing out a project. Closed by
   :func:`test_plain_member_cannot_add_a_member` and its siblings, which are
   the headline cases.
2. A restriction row is read as a grant. Closed by
   :func:`test_a_restriction_never_grants_project_access` and
   :func:`test_hidden_entity_ids_returns_only_a_subset_of_its_input`.
3. An id is walked to discover what exists. Closed by the 404-not-403 cases.

Every case names the original behaviour it guards in its docstring, so the
"put the old behaviour back and watch it fail" check has a target.
