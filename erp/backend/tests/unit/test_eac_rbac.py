"""RBAC tests for the EAC v2 engine (Max-Audit finding #6).

Before this fix the entire EAC router gated every endpoint with only
``CurrentUserId`` + a tenant check - there was no ``permissions.py`` and
no ``on_startup`` hook, so a read-only VIEWER (the default registration
role) could create / edit / delete cost-calculation rules and trigger
runs. This module asserts the new role gate:

* ``eac.read``   -> VIEWER
* ``eac.write``  -> EDITOR  (create/update rule + ruleset, import aliases)
* ``eac.delete`` -> MANAGER (delete rule/ruleset/alias)
* ``eac.run``    -> EDITOR  (run/rerun/cancel/dry-run/validate/compile)

and that EVERY mutating/executing route in the EAC routers (and the
aliases sub-router) actually carries a ``RequirePermission`` dependency,
so a viewer is rejected (403) before any DB work - including the
formula-executing dry-run / validate / compile / resolve paths.

These run at the registry / route-introspection level rather than over
HTTP, mirroring ``tests/unit/test_hse_advanced_security.py`` -
booting the full FastAPI app would load ~110 modules per test.
