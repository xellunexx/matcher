"""Demo seed values that a chart groups by, checked against their reader.

A panel that draws one category called "Not recorded" is not a picture of an
empty register. It is a picture of a full register grouped by a field nothing
populated - either because the writer left it null, or because the writer
spelled the key differently from the reader. The daily diary hit the second
case: the seeder wrote ``weather_summary.condition`` and the insights panel
selects ``weather_summary.conditions``, so four distinct weather codes were
seeded and none was ever found.

Nothing here needs a database. These are source-level drift checks, in the same
family as the vocabulary tests beside them: one value written down in two places
that can move apart.
