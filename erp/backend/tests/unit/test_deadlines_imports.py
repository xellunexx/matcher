"""DB-free import smoke test for the deadlines module (item #18).

The pure-logic test cannot catch an import typo, a bad symbol, or a circular
import in the impure files (service / router / sweeper), and a broken router
import does NOT crash the app - the module loader swallows it and silently
fails to mount. This asserts every impure file imports and the router object
exists with both endpoints.

Engine creation is lazy and sibling-model imports are deferred inside the
collectors, so importing these modules touches no database.

Run:
    cd backend
    python -m pytest tests/unit/test_deadlines_imports.py -q
