# The back-charge status field accepted any string. Both the create and the
# update schema declared it as ``str``, and the update applies a blind setattr
# loop over the payload, so a typo was written straight onto the row. Two things
# then went wrong quietly: the record sat in a state no filter or analytics
# bucket matches, and the agreed / recovered timestamps are stamped by comparing
# the incoming value against the module constants, so neither was set.
#
# These tests pin the closed enumeration and, just as importantly, pin that the
# wire type and the constants cannot drift apart. A future status added to one
# and not the other is exactly how this class of hole reopens.
