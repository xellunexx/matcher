# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Regression tests for the ReDoS input caps added in v11.17.0.

Three server-side regexes take caller-influenced strings and are super-linear
in shape, so a crafted long value could stall a request (stdlib ``re`` has no
timeout). Each call site now bounds the input length before the match runs.
These tests feed each parser a pathological input and assert it (a) still
returns the correct result and (b) completes near-instantly, which only holds
because the length cap keeps the regex off the unbounded string.
