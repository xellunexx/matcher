"""Edge-case unit tests for the working-day offset calendar (cpm.OffsetCalendar).

Pure-Python, no DB. These complement ``test_cpm_offset_calendar.py`` by pinning
the harder corners of the calendar-aware day-offset arithmetic a future CPM
integration can adopt:

* a finish or span that crosses MULTIPLE weekends,
* a holiday that lands exactly on the computed finish (it must be skipped),
* consecutive / block holidays,
* a holiday on an already non-working weekend (no effect),
* NEGATIVE start offsets (work that begins before the calendar epoch),
* custom working weeks (six-day Mon-Sat and a Sun-Thu "Gulf" week),
* round-trip invariants under multiple weekends + holidays,
* ``working_days_between`` over inverted / zero / negative-endpoint spans,
* zero-duration milestone behaviour from a non-working offset,
* the all-days calendar staying byte-for-byte equal to plain arithmetic across
  weekend boundaries.

Nothing in ``compute_cpm`` calls this helper yet; these tests guard the contract
so adoption stays a no-op for projects without a real calendar.
