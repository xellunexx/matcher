"""Regression test for issue #342 - real notifications never reached Telegram.

Connecting Telegram succeeded and the "Test" button delivered a message, but
no real platform notification (task/RFI assignment, mention, status change, ...)
ever arrived. The Test button works because the router calls the telegram send
helper directly; the event-driven path is what was broken.

Root cause: BOTH the integrations connector bridge and the notifications
dispatcher subscribe a module-level function named ``_on_notification_created``
to the same ``notifications.notification.created`` event. Their idempotency
guards compared handlers by ``__qualname__`` - the identical bare string
``"_on_notification_created"`` for both functions - so whichever module loaded
second saw the other's handler and skipped its own subscription. The
notifications module loads first (it is pulled in early as a dependency), so the
integrations bridge was never wired and the connector stayed write-only.

This test wires BOTH registrars through the real event bus in the production
order (dispatcher first, bridge second), publishes a real event, and asserts
the Telegram send path fires. The HTTP send is mocked - no network, no DB.

Before the fix this test fails: the bridge is skipped, ``sends`` stays empty.
After the fix (identity-based idempotency guard) both same-named handlers
coexist and the event reaches Telegram.
