"""Unit tests for the additive working-day offset calendar (cpm.OffsetCalendar).

Pure-Python, no DB - exercises the calendar-aware day-offset arithmetic that a
future CPM integration can adopt to skip weekends and holidays. The existing
``compute_cpm`` passes do NOT use this helper yet; these tests pin its contract
so that adoption is safe:

* the all-days calendar reproduces plain ``es + dur`` / ``ef - dur`` arithmetic
  exactly (the "no calendar effects" opt-out),
* the default Mon-Fri calendar skips weekends,
* explicit holidays are skipped even on a working weekday,
* finish and start offsets are exact inverses (round-trip),
* ``working_days_between`` is exclusive-start / inclusive-end and round-trips a
  finish offset,
* zero / negative durations behave like milestones (offset unchanged).
