"""Verify the Asset Operations router exposes the expected routes.

This is a lightweight mount check that does NOT spin up the full app
lifespan (that path imports the unrelated ``oe_closeout`` module, whose
transitive import of ``app.core.job_runner`` uses the PEP 695 ``type``
statement and only parses on Python 3.12+, the project's target runtime).
The end-to-end HTTP behaviour is covered by
``tests/integration/test_assets_api.py`` on a 3.12 interpreter.
