"""Database-free unit tests for the closeout certifying-artifact gate.

These pin :func:`app.modules.closeout.service._generated_slot_delivered`, the
pure decision behind the handover readiness fix: a generated artifact is never
delivered before the package is built, a *certifying* artifact (punch-closure
report, final-inspection certificate) is delivered only while the live work it
certifies is complete, and a non-certifying export (COBie) is delivered once
built. ``outstanding=None`` is the build-manifest path, which reports every
generated artifact as present regardless of live site state.
