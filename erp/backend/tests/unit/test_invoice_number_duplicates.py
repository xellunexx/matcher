# invoice_number had no protection of any kind. There is no unique constraint on
# the column, and a caller-supplied number was written straight through, so
# posting the same number twice produced two invoices carrying it. That number
# is what reconciliation, payment matching and every accounting export key on,
# so the result is not a display quirk, it is two documents nobody can tell
# apart.
#
# The generator's docstring also claimed that using MAX rather than COUNT avoids
# race conditions. It does not. MAX is what makes numbering survive a deletion;
# it does nothing about concurrency, because nothing between the read and the
# insert holds a lock. That claim is corrected rather than relied upon.
