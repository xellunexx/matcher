"""The build gate that reads the produced desktop sidecar.

``scripts/check_desktop_sidecar_bundle.py`` is the output half of the issue
#419 fix: the hook refuses to build without PostgreSQL's loadable modules, and
this reads the onefile archive that came out and confirms they are inside it.
Neither can see what the other misses, so both have to be right.

The script is wired into the release workflow as a hard step, which makes its
own failure modes interesting: a step that raises takes the Linux sidecar job
with it, and no installer ships at all. That is the same user-visible outcome
as #419. So the cases here are about the script's behaviour, not PyInstaller's.
The archive reader is stubbed, because what it returns is already settled by
the smoke test against real onefile executables; what is not settled is what
this script does with the names.

Cases:
    * a bundle carrying the modules and the executables passes
    * a bundle missing dict_snowball fails and says why
    * a Windows bundle, where the same modules are .dll, passes
    * an empty archive fails rather than passing vacuously
    * a path that is not a file fails without reaching the reader
    * the suffix stripping does not confuse a module with a longer name
    * a support file of the same name elsewhere in the tree does not stand in
      for the module or the executable
