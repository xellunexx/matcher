"""The rule that decides whether a contract has anybody who can sign it.

``contracts.parties_complete`` used to apply only to a contract that was
already active or completed, while the only moment its answer matters is the
press of "put up for signature", which only ever happens on a draft. The two
conditions were mutually exclusive, so the rule could not fire at the moment it
was written for, and what actually stopped the press was a refusal hardcoded in
the service: no rule id, no suggestion, and nothing on screen beforehand.

The rule also used to ask for a named employer and a named contractor. That is
one contract's shape. A subcontract is executed by the main contractor and the
firm selling the work, and the employer is deliberately not a party to it, so
the old wording reported every subcontract in the register as missing a party
it should never have had. The rule now asks for two *distinct signing roles*,
which is true of both shapes and of neither's vocabulary in particular.

These are pure dict-context checks with no database and no engine, which is the
level the mistake lived at: every test that exercised signing built a contract
with parties, and it built them as a main contract, so nothing ever asked the
rule about a draft and nothing ever asked it about a subcontract.

Two of them are about what the rule must NOT do. A context carrying positions
and no contract is the compliance gate's payload, and a rule that fired there
would report a missing party against a schedule of values. And a party entered
as a link rather than as typed text has an empty stored name, which is why the
service resolves the name before the context is built - a rule reading the
stored field alone would call a register empty while the screen names the
employer.

The last one is the invariant the service leans on. Deleting the hardcoded
refusal is only safe if this rule passing means the signature block has
somebody to address, so it is asserted against the real function rather than
argued in a comment.
