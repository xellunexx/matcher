"""Regression test for documents/router.py download containment check.

Background
----------
Before v2.6.40, the download endpoint did::

    file_path = Path(doc.file_path).resolve()
    upload_base = Path(UPLOAD_BASE).resolve()
    file_path.relative_to(upload_base)

For demo seed records that store ``file_path`` as a *relative* path like
``demo/medical-us/foo.pdf``, ``Path.resolve()`` resolves against the
*current working directory*, not against ``UPLOAD_BASE``. The path
escapes the base, ``relative_to`` raises ``ValueError``, and the user
sees an unconditional 403 on every demo download.

The fix prefixes relative paths with ``upload_base`` *before* resolving::

    raw = Path(doc.file_path)
    file_path = (raw if raw.is_absolute() else upload_base / raw).resolve()

This test verifies the containment check accepts relatives, accepts
in-base absolutes, and still rejects path-traversal escapes.
