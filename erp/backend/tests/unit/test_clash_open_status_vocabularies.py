"""The clash package defines "open" twice, for two different questions (#187).

``clash.schemas.OPEN_STATUSES`` answers "which ``ClashResult.status`` values
still need attention" and is drawn from ``CLASH_STATUSES``. It is what every
``ClashResult`` query filters by.

``clash.risk_matrix.OPEN_RESULT_OR_ISSUE_STATUSES`` answers a wider question:
``risk_matrix`` is a pure, DB-free module handed plain ``ClashScheduleFacts``,
so it cannot tell whether a ``status`` came off a ``ClashResult`` row or off a
smart ``ClashIssue`` (``CLASH_ISSUE_STATUSES``, whose open states are ``new``
and ``persisted``). Its set is the union of both vocabularies.

The two therefore are not duplication, and merging them would be wrong in
either direction: narrowing the risk set to the row set would drop a
``persisted`` issue, and widening the row filter to the union would put
``persisted`` into a SQL ``IN`` clause against a column that can never hold
it. They only ever looked like duplication because both were called
``OPEN_STATUSES``.

These tests pin each set to its own vocabulary and pin the containment that
has to hold between them, so a future edit to either one cannot silently
drift. Modelled on ``tests/unit/test_back_charge_status_enum.py``.
