"""Unit tests for the 8.6.1 BIM data-dir fix as it touches project-bundle export.

Background
----------
``app.modules.projects.bundle_export`` collected BIM geometry by treating
``BIMModel.canonical_file_path`` as a filesystem path and probing it with
``os.path.exists`` / ``open`` relative to the process CWD. But that column holds
a storage KEY (``bim/{project}/{model}/geometry.glb``), not a filesystem path -
so on any deployment where CWD != data root (standalone / external-Postgres,
Docker, macOS) the geometry was recorded ``{"missing": true}`` and silently
dropped from the ``.ocep`` zip, and it could NEVER resolve under an S3 backend.

The fix reads BIM geometry through the storage backend (``backend.get(key)``)
and writes the bytes into the zip with ``zf.writestr``. These tests pin that
behaviour:

* a present geometry key is read CWD-independently (the actual bug),
* the bytes read through the backend are exactly what gets hashed,
* a truly-absent key resolves to ``None`` (recorded as missing, not crashing),
* a path-traversal key is rejected, not served.

The module is import-coupled to PostgreSQL (``app.database`` at import time), so
the import is guarded with ``importorskip`` - the test runs on CI (py3.11 with
embedded PG) and skips cleanly on a no-DB local box.
