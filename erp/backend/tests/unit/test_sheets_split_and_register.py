"""What the sheet register actually holds after a drawing set is split.

The register's new screen displays exactly what ``split_pdf_to_sheets`` wrote,
so these tests pin the split's output rather than its plumbing: one row per
page, the page order, what happens to a page whose title block cannot be read,
and what a second split of the same file does. ``test_epic_c_versioning``
already covers the ``FileVersion`` chain the split writes; it asserts the sheet
count and nothing else about the rows.

The PDFs are real, rendered with reportlab, so ``detect_sheet_info`` runs
against text pdfplumber genuinely extracted. Tests that need one skip where
reportlab is unavailable; the two aggregation tests seed rows directly and
always run.

Storage is redirected at the test's tmp dir. Without that the split writes the
PDF and its thumbnails under ``~/.openestimator`` on the machine running the
suite, which is where the application keeps real uploads.

    ``current_by_sheet_numbers`` is what decides which row an incoming revision
    records as its predecessor, and it picks by reading the rows in ascending
    order and letting the last one win. It ordered on ``created_at`` alone.

    That column is written per row by a Python default, so it is only as fine as
    the clock underneath it, and on a coarse one an entire import batch carries
    a single value. Duplicates in this register are produced by exactly that,
    one upload writing the same number on two pages, which is the case where the
    timestamp has nothing left to order by. What answered then was the plan.

    So the two projects here hold identical rows written in opposite orders,
    with the created instant pinned equal on purpose. Anything that resolves
    them by arrival answers differently for the two, and this asserts they
    agree. Pinning the timestamps rather than sleeping between the inserts also
    keeps the test from passing on a machine whose clock happens to be fine
    enough to separate them, which is what CI has and this box does not.

    What this does NOT cover: pinning the instants equal is what makes the id
    carry the whole assertion, so an implementation that ordered on the id alone
    and dropped ``created_at`` would pass this too. The created component is
    reasoned from what the column is for, not measured here, and a test that
    separated the two would have to rely on the clock this one deliberately
    takes out of the picture.
