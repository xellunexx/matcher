"""Assemblies must never report one number that holds two currencies.

The apply-template preview converts each matched component into the target
currency and rolls the results into ``grand_total``. When no rate could be found
it used to return the component's UNCONVERTED amount and add that to the very
same total, so a component priced in one currency contributed its face value to
a sum labelled with another. A warning was attached, and the number stayed
wrong: 100 EUR plus 1000 of an unpriceable currency was reported as 1100 EUR.

These tests pin the invariant that replaced it. Every amount is banked under one
ISO code, and the single-scalar fields (``grand_total`` / ``total_rate``) are
withheld entirely when more than one currency is in play - refusing to name a
total being the only honest answer when part of it could not be priced.

They also pin the DIRECTION of every conversion. ``Project.fx_rates`` is quoted
as "base units per 1 unit of the foreign currency" and ``oe_fx``'s ``cross_rate``
as "target units per one source unit"; both are applied by multiplication, so an
inverted rate yields a plausible number and raises nothing. Each conversion
assertion therefore checks an exact expected value against an asymmetric rate,
which a round-trip assertion would not catch.

No database is involved: the repositories and the catalogue matcher are stubbed,
and passing ``session=None`` makes the FX register resolve against the bundled
seed.
