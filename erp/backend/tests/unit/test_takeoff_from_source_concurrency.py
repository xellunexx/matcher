"""From-source takeoff is concurrency-safe (issue #369).

``POST /documents/from-source`` find-or-creates a takeoff document per
``(project_id, source_document_id)``. The lookup-then-insert used to race, so
two concurrent opens of one source PDF could both miss and both insert,
minting duplicate rows and stranding measurements on an unreachable duplicate.
A unique index now rejects the second insert, and the service resolves that
``IntegrityError`` to the winning row instead of surfacing it, so both callers
converge on one shared document.

Hermetic: the session and repositories are mocked, so these pin the service
logic without a database (mirrors test_takeoff_measurement_document_identity).
