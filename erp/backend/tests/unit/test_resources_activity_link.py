"""An assignment can name the schedule activity it staffs.

Covers the whole of the link: the column is persisted on create and on
propose, a PATCH can both set and clear it, the list query filters on it, the
by-activity read stays inside the project whose access was verified, and the
``resources`` rule set both fires and stays quiet on the right inputs.

The rule tests do not stop at calling ``Rule().validate(...)``. A rule that no
engine ever reaches passes that kind of test exactly as a working one does, so
the reachability of the set is asserted separately and one finding is followed
all the way out of ``validation_engine.validate``.
