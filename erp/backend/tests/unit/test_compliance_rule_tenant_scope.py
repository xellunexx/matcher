"""Tenant-isolation tests for compliance DSL rule registration.

The validation ``rule_registry`` is a single process-global singleton with
no tenant dimension. Compliance DSL rules are authored per tenant, so the
service must namespace every rule by its tenant before it touches the
registry - otherwise (a) tenant B could run a rule set by name and execute
tenant A's rule against tenant B's data, and (b) a tenant could register a
``rule_id`` / ``standard`` matching a built-in and overwrite the built-in's
body, or inject into a built-in set, for everyone.

These tests exercise the namespacing helpers directly and via a real
``compile_rule`` + ``rule_registry.register`` round-trip, and assert that:

* built-ins (bare id, bare set) are never overwritten or polluted;
* a tenant's rule is reachable ONLY under its ``t:{tenant}:`` scoped id and
  scoped set;
* the bare/global set does not gain the tenant's scoped id;
* one tenant's delete cannot evict a built-in or another tenant's rule;
* a tenant cannot escape its namespace by stuffing colons into ``standard``
  or ``rule_sets`` (only ``rule_id`` is colon-restricted by the parser).

Every test cleans the registry entries it adds so global state never leaks
into other tests in the shard.
