"""Every write path into ``oe_finance_budget`` must supply a currency.

``ProjectBudget.currency_code`` deliberately carries no database default
(``finance/models.py:197-206``): "no DB default; service code MUST supply
currency from the project context so per-project rollups don't silently
bias toward EUR". The column defaults to ``""`` in Python only so raw-SQL
backfills during migration stay safe.

Nothing enforced that contract, so four of the six construction sites
omitted the keyword and wrote budget lines with an empty currency. Those
rows reach the finance table with no currency at all, and ``MoneyDisplay``
- which correctly refuses to guess one - renders every cell as an
em-dash. The screen reads as lost numbers rather than an empty state.

The first test is a static gate rather than a behavioural one on purpose:
the defect is a *class* (a new write path forgetting the field), each
instance sits behind a different trigger (a demo install, an approved
estimate, an approved variation, a locked BOQ), and a gate that only
covers the four known sites would not catch the fifth.
