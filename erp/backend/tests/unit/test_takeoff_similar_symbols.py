# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction - OpenConstructionERP
"""Unit tests for seeded similar-symbol search ("count by example").

Exercises :func:`app.modules.takeoff.recognize.find_similar_symbols` with
synthetic ``get_drawings()``-shaped input (plain tuples) - no PDF, PyMuPDF or
database needed. The user clicks one symbol on the page and we return every
near-identical symbol so they can confirm them as a single count measurement;
nothing is persisted here (CLAUDE.md rule 7).
