"""Every measurement records where its scale came from, or admits it does not.

A wrong scale is the one takeoff error that multiplies through every quantity
on a sheet. Storing the ratio without its origin means a takeoff found to be
mis-scaled cannot be narrowed to the rows that actually inherited the bad
calibration, so the whole document goes back to be re-checked by hand.

The tests below pin the two halves of that promise. The easy half is that each
creation path stamps the right source. The half that actually protects the
user is that no path ever stamps a source it does not know: an unstated source
stays NULL, a page with no scale yields no source, and a patch that moves the
ratio without saying why clears the old label rather than letting it stand as
a claim that has quietly become false. A wrong provenance is worse than a
missing one, because it is the one a recompute would trust.
