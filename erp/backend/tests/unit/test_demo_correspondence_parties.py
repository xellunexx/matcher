"""Every seeded letter must name a party the demo actually has a contact for.

The correspondence seeds carry the counterparty as a role on the seed tuple.
The writer turns that role into a contact id, so a role with no matching
contact produces a letter linked to nobody, which is the state this change was
made to end. Three of the ten letters are with a permitting body, the notice of
commencement, its acknowledgement and the inspection report, and the generated
contact list had no authority in it at all.

The role deliberately is not read back out of the subject line. The subjects do
name the party and parsing them is the obvious shortcut, but they are English
prose written to be read on a screen and they get reworded; a parser keyed on
the word "Authority" would keep producing rows after a rewording, pointing at
the wrong contact or at none, with nothing to notice. That makes the pairing
between the two lists a thing worth asserting rather than deriving.

What this does not cover: the resolution itself lives in the seeding writer and
needs a database to reach, so the direction rule (an outgoing letter fills
to_contact_ids, an incoming one fills from_contact_id) is not exercised here.
This file checks the half reachable without one, which is that every role named
is a role the demo seeds.
