"""What box the DXF path stores, and what a block reference brings with it.

Three defects met here, all of them invisible to the suite because nothing
compared the parser's answer to the service's answer for the same drawing:

* ``parse_dxf`` unioned every layout into one extents, so an A3 title block in
  Layout1 made a 10-unit drawing report 420x297 - a box nobody is ever shown,
  and the box the unit inference reads.
* Its extents loop looked for ``insertion_point``, which no writer in this
  codebase emits - every writer emits ``insert`` - so a block placement was
  invisible to the parser while the service's copy of the same rule saw it.
  The two functions reported different boxes for the same file.
* Rotation was passed through in ezdxf's degrees while the viewer feeds it
  straight to ``ctx.rotate``, which is radians. Text authored at 90 degrees
  rendered at 90 radians.

The last class of test here is the one that would have caught the second
defect on the day it landed: it asserts the two functions agree.
