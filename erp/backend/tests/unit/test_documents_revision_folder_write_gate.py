"""Folder-permission write gate on ``upload_document_revision`` (Finding #25).

Background
----------
``upload_document`` and ``delete_document`` both resolve the document's
folder scope via ``folder_access_for`` and reject a caller who holds only a
``viewer`` grant on a restricted/managed folder (even when they carry the
project-wide ``documents.update`` permission). ``upload_document_revision``
previously skipped that check entirely - it only ran ``RequirePermission``
+ ``verify_project_access`` - so a read-only folder member could replace
the served file bytes of any document in that folder by POSTing a revision,
defeating the whole folder write gate.

These tests call the router handler directly (no ASGI / DB) with the
``DocumentService`` stubbed and ``verify_project_access`` patched to a
no-op (a project MEMBER already clears that gate). They assert that:

    1. a ``viewer`` folder grant is rejected with 404 BEFORE the service
       is asked to write any bytes (this FAILS on the pre-fix code, where
       the revision was uploaded unconditionally),
    2. an ``editor`` grant is accepted (the fix must not over-block
       legitimate writers),
    3. the project-OWNER role ("owner" from ``folder_access_for``) is
       accepted.

Mirrors the patch-style of ``test_dms_folder_permissions.py`` (patching
``folder_permissions_service`` helpers) and the source guard in
``test_idor_router_guards.py``.
