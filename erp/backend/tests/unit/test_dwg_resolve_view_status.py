"""Unit tests for ``DwgTakeoffService.resolve_view_status``.

This pure static method is what stops the fresh-install "perpetual
Converting..." spinner on /dwg-takeoff: a seeded ``.dwg`` row sits at
``status="uploaded"`` with no parsed entities, and with no DDC DwgExporter on
disk nothing ever transitions it. ``resolve_view_status`` must always return a
terminal, actionable answer for the viewer. These tests pin every branch so a
future edit cannot silently bring the spinner back.

The function is pure (no DB, no async); for the ``.dwg`` branches we always
pass ``converter_present`` explicitly so the test never touches the filesystem
probe in ``get_offline_readiness``.
