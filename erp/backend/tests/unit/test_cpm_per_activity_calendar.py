"""Unit tests for per-activity work calendars in the CPM engine.

``app.core.cpm.calculate_cpm`` lets each activity carry its own ``calendar``
({"work_days": [...], "exceptions": [...]}) so its duration is measured on its
own work week - a six-day trade finishes sooner than a five-day one over the
same duration, a crew with its own holidays finishes later. An activity without
its own calendar falls back to the schedule-wide ``calendar`` argument, so the
default path is unchanged. These pin that behaviour, and that the working-day
snap (which keeps a weekend-anchored root off the critical path) uses the
activity's own calendar too.

2024-01-01 is a Monday, so day-offsets map cleanly: offset 5 = Saturday
2024-01-06, offset 6 = Sunday 2024-01-07.
