"""Whether the two CWICR work-name columns are joined depends on the base type.

The classic CIS parquets split one sentence across ``rate_original_name`` and
``rate_final_name``, so those must be concatenated. The national bases carry two
parallel full descriptions of the same item, so joining them prints it twice.
Both diverge in ~100% of rows, so only the base type can tell them apart - these
tests pin both sides of that decision.
