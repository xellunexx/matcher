"""The Qdrant health probe does not send a loopback request to a proxy.

``urllib.request.urlopen`` uses the default opener, whose ``ProxyHandler`` is
seeded from the environment. Its bypass check is ``no_proxy`` alone on POSIX,
so loopback is not exempt unless the operator listed it. A machine with
``http_proxy`` set therefore had its probe of a Qdrant running on the same host
answered by the proxy, and the vector-database card told the user Qdrant was
not installed and offered to download it.

The visible cost of getting this wrong is not a slow page: it is a card that
states the opposite of the truth and sends the user to install software they
already have. These tests pin which opener each kind of URL gets, and that the
loopback one really carries no proxies, because an opener built with the
default handler set would pass the first check and fail the user.
