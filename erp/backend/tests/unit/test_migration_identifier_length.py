"""Every identifier a migration names must fit PostgreSQL's 63-character limit.

PostgreSQL truncates identifiers at ``NAMEDATALEN - 1`` = 63 characters, and
SQLAlchemy refuses to emit a name it knows would be silently cut, raising
``IdentifierError`` before any DDL is sent. Because PostgreSQL runs DDL inside a
transaction, that failure rolls back the entire ``alembic upgrade head``, so a
site upgrading across several releases receives *none* of the revisions rather
than stopping at the offending one.

That is how a 65-character foreign key name in ``v3280_contract_templates``
made an entire release unmigratable on PostgreSQL while passing every test we
had. SQLite has no such limit, so the revision applied cleanly wherever the
suite happened to run, and nothing in the tree compared a name against 63.

This guard is deliberately a string scan rather than a database round trip. The
point is to catch the name *before* release without requiring a PostgreSQL
service in the matrix, so it stays cheap enough to attach anywhere.
