"""Unit tests for the CPM engine's per-activity ``start_offset`` floor.

``app.core.cpm.calculate_cpm`` is the engine the schedule module's
``reschedule`` runs. A root activity has no predecessor, so before
``start_offset`` existed the forward pass floored its early_start at 0 (the
project origin) and its successors were scheduled from there, regardless of the
root's real manual start. On a project with more than one independent chain
that placed a later chain's successor BEFORE its own predecessor. These tests
pin the fix: a root's ``start_offset`` anchors it (and therefore its
successors) at its real start, while an omitted offset keeps the historical
origin-anchored behaviour.
