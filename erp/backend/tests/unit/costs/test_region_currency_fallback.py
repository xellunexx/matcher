"""Unit tests for the region → currency table and its warning path.

Audit fix #1 (2026-05-21): ``_resolve_currency`` previously fell through
silently to ``EUR`` on unknown/malformed regions.

Currency-correctness fix (2026-05-31): the silent ``EUR`` fallback for a
genuinely-unknown region was itself a bug — labelling a Kenyan/Thai/Korean
rate as EUR corrupts every downstream cross-currency conversion. The helper
now returns ``""`` (unset, honestly "unknown") instead of a wrong "EUR".

Loadable-region fix (2026-08-03): the table was derived from the v3 snapshot
registry, while the set of bases the importer accepts comes from
``base_registry.github_workitems_files()``. Twelve of the thirty-eight
loadable regions were missing from the table, so importing any of them
resolved to ``""`` and wrote a whole catalogue of rates with no currency on
them. One such import left 55 718 rows that way. The table is now built from
the same registry the loader reads, and the invariant below is the gate: a
base that can be loaded can be priced.

These tests lock in:

    1. Malformed regions log a warning, append the message to the
       caller-supplied ``warnings`` list, and resolve to "" (unset).
    2. Unknown but well-formed regions log a warning AND resolve to "".
    3. Every base the importer will load resolves to the currency its own
       registry entry declares.
    4. The well-known regions (PT_LISBON, DE_BERLIN, ...) still resolve
       correctly and emit NO warning.
    5. Duplicate warnings are de-duplicated within a single request.
    6. Every available v3 catalogue region resolves to its declared
       currency — never a wrong fallback.
    7. The read path and the write path share one table, not two copies of
       the same construction.
