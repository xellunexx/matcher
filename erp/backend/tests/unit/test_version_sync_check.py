"""The release gate that reads every version literal in the tree.

``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` is the only thing standing between a release
and a build whose parts disagree about which version they are. It grew one
literal at a time and the newest one, the Tauri crate manifest, was added after
that manifest had already drifted eleven minor releases behind everything else
without a single gate noticing.

Two things are worth testing here and they fail differently.

The first is how the Cargo version is located. A Cargo manifest carries a
``version`` for the package and another for every dependency, and the reader
has to be anchored on the ``[package]`` table. A first-match scan happens to be
right today only because ``[package]`` is conventionally written first and the
dependencies use inline tables; both of those are conventions, not rules, and
when either changes the scan starts validating a dependency's version and
passes forever while checking a literal nobody bumps. That is not a check that
gets worse, it is a check that reports all-clear on a tree it never read. The
cases below reorder the tables and take the package version away to show the
anchor holding where a first-match scan would not.

The second is whether the literals actually agree right now. That one reads
the real tree, so it is a statement about the repository rather than about the
code, and it is the assertion the release depends on.

Cases:
    * the reader returns the package version, not a dependency's
    * a dependency table written before ``[package]`` does not capture it
    * an inherited ``version.workspace`` fails loudly instead of falling
      through to the first dependency below it
    * a manifest with no ``[package]`` table fails rather than passing
    * the live manifest reads the same as a real TOML parser reads it
    * the lockfile entry is found by crate name, past 538 decoy entries
    * a lockfile missing the crate fails by name instead of checking nothing
    * the live lockfile reads the same as a real TOML parser reads it

Deliberately not here: an assertion that the literals in the tree agree right
now. ``Repo hygiene`` runs ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` against the real
files on every push, with no branch filter, so a copy of that assertion in this
file would be a second check of one thing. What is left here is what the script
run cannot cover, namely the reader's behaviour on manifest and lockfile shapes
that do not exist in the tree and would not until the day they broke it.
