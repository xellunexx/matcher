# Regression tests for two ways the Pipeline Builder used to compute money over
# a subset of the data while presenting the answer as the whole.
#
# 1. ``transform.filter`` read ``upstream["rows"]``. That key is a bounded
#    PREVIEW capped at ``_SAMPLE_LIMIT`` (25) and exists for the run UI, not for
#    arithmetic. A source -> filter -> rollup graph therefore reported a grand
#    total over at most 25 positions and labelled it the project total.
#
# 2. ``_resolve_full_rows`` re-read positions by ``row_ids``, which the source
#    caps at ``_ROW_IDS_CAP`` (5000) to keep the node-state JSON small. A
#    project past the cap got a total over its first 5000 positions, again with
#    nothing marking it short. The envelope now carries the source scope so the
#    real set can be re-read.
#
# Both are exercised with a stub session rather than the module's PostgreSQL
# harness: the defect is in which rows the code chooses to read, so the test
# only has to observe the query it issues.
