# Regression guard for a module that ships a REST surface nobody can reach.
#
# Background: the portfolio module shipped a full router, service, models and
# Alembic revisions, but no ``manifest.py``. ``ModuleLoader.discover()`` skips
# any package without one, so the router never mounted and all ten
# ``/api/v1/portfolio/`` endpoints answered 404, while the frontend page kept
# calling them. Nothing failed loudly: the tables were still created, because
# schema provisioning scans the package directory rather than reading the
# manifest list, so the only symptom was a page that stayed empty.
#
# The rule this pins is narrow on purpose. A package with no ``router.py`` is a
# shared helper library, not a module, and correctly has no manifest (einvoice,
# measurement and price_breakdown are all imported directly by finance, boq and
# postcalc). What must never happen again is a package that DEFINES routes and
# is nevertheless invisible to the loader.
