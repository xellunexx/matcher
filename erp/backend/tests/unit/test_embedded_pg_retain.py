"""A retained cluster survives an application shutdown.

The application stops the embedded cluster from its own shutdown handler. That
is right when the application booted it and wrong when something longer-lived
did. The test session boots one cluster for the whole run, so without the pin
the first test that exercises the app lifespan stopped the postmaster and every
test after it errored on connect with ConnectionRefusedError.

These tests drive the ownership rule directly with a stand-in server, so they
need no database and cannot themselves disturb the session's cluster.
