"""Regression: the job runner must run in-process when Celery is absent.

Celery/kombu is an OPTIONAL extra (``celery[redis]`` in
``[project.optional-dependencies]``); the default ``pip install`` and the
shipped wheel run the lightweight, Redis-optional deploy without it. Before
this fix ``_dispatch_to_celery`` imported ``kombu`` unconditionally, so on a
Celery-less install every background job (pipeline run, AI estimate, geo-hub
tiling, …) raised ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kombu'``. That is
NOT a :class:`BrokerUnavailableError`, so ``submit_job`` never fell back to the
in-process runner - it hit the generic ``except``, marked the JobRun failed and
re-raised, surfacing as a hard 500 on ``POST /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/run``.

Every pre-existing job/pipeline test patches ``_dispatch_to_celery`` with a mock
return value, so this exact path - the transport imports themselves failing -
was never exercised. These two tests pin it:

1. a missing transport maps to :class:`BrokerUnavailableError` (unit, no DB);
2. ``submit_job`` then runs the handler IN-PROCESS and the JobRun reaches
   ``success`` without the caller ever seeing an exception (end-to-end).
