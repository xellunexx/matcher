"""The demo estate must speak the variations module's own status vocabulary.

The demo generator wrote "agreed" and "implemented" on two of every three
variation orders. Both read naturally in English and neither is in
``_VO_STATUS``, the pattern the module validates writes against, so the seeded
rows carried a status the module itself would refuse and could not offer back
in a status dropdown. Nothing caught it because the seeder inserts through the
ORM and never passes the Pydantic layer that owns the vocabulary.

The second test exists so this file cannot pass by being toothless: it feeds the
exact string that was wrong through the same assertion and requires it to be
rejected.
