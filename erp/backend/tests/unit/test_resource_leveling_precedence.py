"""Precedence feasibility of the resource-leveling priority queue.

The leveler orders activities by the shipped key (LS asc -> total_float asc ->
id) and places them one at a time, bounding each start by the predecessors it has
already placed. That key is only precedence-feasible while lag is non-negative::

    FS lag L: LS(pred) <= LS(succ) - L - dur(pred)
    SS lag L: LS(pred) <= LS(succ) - L

Under a negative lag a predecessor can sort AFTER its own successor. The
successor is then bounded by nothing (its predecessor is unplaced, so
``_earliest_legal_start`` skips it) and lands on its base CPM early start, which
can violate the link the CPM page draws.

These tests pin the fix from both sides: the emitted plan must satisfy every link
it was given, and FS-only networks must keep the order -- and therefore the diff
-- they had before the gate existed.

Pure module: imports only the engine, the CPM engine and the standard library, so
it runs without a database.
