"""Tests for the multi-project (schedule-of-schedules) CPM engine - T3.3.

Pure-Python, no DB - everything under test post-processes the output of the
single-project kernel ``compute_cpm`` and imports nothing beyond the
``portfolio_cpm`` + ``cpm`` modules and the standard library.

Coverage maps to the roadmap acceptance criteria for the PURE engine:

* #5 (standalone boundary floor): a B->A cross-project edge modelled as a
  :class:`BoundaryConstraint` floors A's early start at the frozen boundary
  index even though B's activities are absent; a ``broken``-status boundary
  still constrains using the frozen index.
* #6 (cross-project cycle): a cycle that exists only across projects
  (A->B->A via ``cross_edges``) raises :class:`CycleError`.
* a genuine portfolio super-graph pass over two schedules joined by an
  in-scope cross edge: the global early-finish and critical path are correct.
* synthetic boundary nodes never appear in results or the critical path.

Plus: determinism under shuffled input, multiple boundaries on one activity,
the largest of several floors wins, lag handling (incl. negative lag),
stale-status parity with live, and validation of unsupported link types.
