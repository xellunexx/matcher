"""Resource-category normalisation: machinery must stay distinct from equipment.

Regression for the methodology engine. The post-Soviet СМР/SMR cascade splits
construction machinery (which rides inside the SMR works base) from installed
equipment (which carries only some markups) - see
``app.modules.methodology.templates._CASCADE_BASE_MAPPING`` (Uzbekistan /
railway). The BOQ cost breakdown used to fold ``machinery`` into ``equipment``,
which silently zeroed the machinery base and over-stated equipment whenever a
methodology computed from a ``boq_id``. These tests pin the split so that
regression cannot return.
