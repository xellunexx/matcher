"""Baseline tests for the Markups module — Round 3 Wave A sweep.

Pins the contract for the markups-module remediation done this round:

* Calibration / measurement columns persist as ``Decimal``
  (Float → ``Numeric(18, 6)`` on PostgreSQL; SQLAlchemy round-trips the
  value as a ``Decimal`` unchanged).
* Pagination on the list endpoint honours the platform-standard
  ``offset`` + ``limit`` slice rather than a confusing ``page`` rail
  (``page`` survives only as a deprecated *drawing-page* filter alias).
* ``verify_project_access`` rejects access to a project the user does
  not own — the auth gate cannot be silently dropped from the listing
  route in a future refactor.

Stamp-template tenancy is pinned here too. The rule the module actually
implements is *global templates carry ``project_id IS NULL``* — see
``MarkupsService.seed_default_stamps`` (which writes every shipped stamp
with ``project_id=None``) and the ``_authorize_stamp_mutation`` docstring
in the router. ``category == "predefined"`` is a label, not a scope, and
the demo seeder writes project-scoped rows carrying it. The three tests
below hold both halves: one project must not see another project's own
templates, and the shipped global ones must stay visible to everyone.

The test runs on a transaction-isolated PostgreSQL session (rolled back
on teardown) via ``tests._pg.transactional_session`` — never
``backend/openestimate.db``.
