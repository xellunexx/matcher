"""Tests for the claims-grade CPM extensions (T1.2).

Pure-Python, no DB - every function under test post-processes the output of
``compute_cpm`` (plus the network adjacency) and imports nothing beyond the
``cpm`` module and the standard library.

Coverage
--------
* parity: ``select_critical("total_float")`` == ``compute_cpm`` critical set,
  and ES/EF/LS/LF are untouched by the new code path.
* longest path picks the date-driving chain even when the float-based
  critical set is larger (disconnected islands).
* multiple float paths: strictly descending length, ``relative_float`` starts
  at 0 and is non-decreasing, path 1 == longest path.
* the three out-of-sequence modes on a fixed data date with an early-started
  finish-to-start successor: override finish <= actual-dates finish <=
  retained finish, and all three reduce to the planning result when there is
  no data date and no actuals.
* determinism: shuffled input activity order yields identical longest path,
  float-path ordering and QA-log ordering.
* scheduling QA log raises and sorts every finding type.
* generated explain strings never contradict the computed numbers.
