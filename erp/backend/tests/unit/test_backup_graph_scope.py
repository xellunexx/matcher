"""DB-free tests for the schema-driven backup scope derivation.

Builds a synthetic SQLAlchemy schema (no app import, no database) and checks the
fixpoint reproduces the ownership rules: user columns, project_id by name, FK
children, OR'd predicates, friendly keys, users root, and skipping of reference
