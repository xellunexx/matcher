"""Outbound webhook senders must refuse SSRF-unsafe target URLs.

Discord / Slack / Teams webhook URLs are configured by a tenant admin and
POSTed to server-side, so a URL pointing at loopback, a private LAN address,
link-local (which covers the cloud-metadata address), or a non-http(s) scheme
must be rejected at dispatch, before any network call is made. A normal public
webhook URL still goes through. The senders reuse ``app.core.url_safety`` for
this, the same guard the integration config path already applies.
