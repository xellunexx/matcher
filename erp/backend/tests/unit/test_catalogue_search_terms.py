"""The assembly picker has to find what an estimator types.

Issue #406 was reported against a Swiss civil-works catalogue and the
reporter supplied the five positions his estimator picks between, plus the
two queries the man actually types. Both are in here verbatim, and they are
what makes these tests worth having: the five names share a long head and
differ only at the tail, so a filter that matched on the head would pass a
test built from invented names and still fail the day it shipped.

``grue tour`` is the case a whole-query LIKE cannot serve at any level of
effort. The stored text reads "grue a tour", so the typed string is not a
substring of it, and no amount of case folding changes that. ``acces
difficile`` is the accent case: he types on a laptop keyboard without
accents, the catalogue carries them.
