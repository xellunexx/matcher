"""A contacts import must not quietly refile a party as something else.

The row loop of the file import rewrote any contact_type it did not recognise
to supplier and said nothing about it, so a file naming main contractors
imported a register of suppliers and returned success. The two checks either
side of it, the email and the country code, both reject the row and report it.

The resolution now sits in its own function so it can be reached without a
route, a database or an upload, which is the whole reason the branch had no
test before.

The empty cell is a separate case and still defaults. A file exported from an
address book often has no such column at all, and supplier is a fair reading of
saying nothing; the bug was reading a wrong answer as if it were no answer.
