"""The dates on a demo RFI have to agree with the labels the register prints.

On the RFI screen a row printed "22d" in the DAYS column and a red "+113" pill
beside it, meaning it was raised 22 days ago and is 113 days past its deadline:
a deadline 91 days before the request existed. The cause was two clocks. The
seeder dated ``response_due_date`` and ``responded_at`` off the project's story
start, a fixed calendar date, while ``created_at`` fell through to the column
default, which is the moment the demo was installed. The answered half of the
register read a response time of 0d for the same reason, the response sitting
months before the row was created and the router clamping a negative span.

The numbers here come from ``_compute_rfi_fields``, the router function that
produced those two, rather than from a copy of its arithmetic in the test. Both
sides of the seeder's ``_RFIS.get(demo_id) or generated`` choice are covered:
the curated status lists are read out of the source, and the generated demos
alternate answered and open, which is a shape no curated list has.
