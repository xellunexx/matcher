"""The health report says when nothing in the process can talk to the server.

A running vector database and a client library for it are two separate things,
and the shipped containers and the desktop build have neither. Both install the
base dependency set, so ``qdrant_client`` was never present, and every match
came back with no candidates because the adapter raised on the import long
before a URL was dialled.

The old report had no field for this, so the one case where it mattered most,
server up and no client, was reported as healthy: a green card above a matcher
that could not return anything. Worse, when the server was also down the card
offered to download it, and a user who took that offer got a running server and
the same empty results, because the missing piece was never the server.

These tests pin the field on all four report paths and pin that the offer to
download is withheld when it would not help.
