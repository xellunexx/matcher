"""Every contact the demo seeds must be a contact the API would accept.

The seeder builds ``Contact`` rows through the ORM, so ``contact_type`` never
meets ``ContactCreate`` on the way in. It wrote "contractor" on the generated
path, which reaches every generated demo, and "authority" in the hand-built
German project. Neither was in the schema's allowed set, so the product shipped
records its own create endpoint would refuse. Nothing crashed, which is why it
went unreported; the tell was the edit form, where the contact type is required
and its chip is selected by matching the stored value, so those rows opened with
nothing chosen and picking a chip silently rewrote the party's role.

This is the same failure as the variation-order vocabulary, from the same cause,
which is why there are two files rather than one broad "seeder is valid" test:
each names the field it guards.

Two tests do the work because the two blocks are reachable in different ways.
The generator can be called directly, so its contacts are validated as real
objects. The hand-built block is a local inside the seeding function and needs a
database to reach, so it is covered by reading the literals out of the source.
The third test keeps the file honest: it feeds a value the schema rejects
through the same assertion and requires it to fail.
