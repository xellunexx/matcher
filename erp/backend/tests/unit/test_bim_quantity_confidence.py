"""Unit tests for the quantity-map match-quality confidence helper.

``BIMHubService._match_quality_confidence`` derives the confidence bucket that
is stamped onto an auto-created BOQ position (``source='cad_import'``) when a
quantity rule is applied. The thresholds intentionally mirror the frontend
``draftConfidence`` so the sandbox preview and the persisted provenance agree.
