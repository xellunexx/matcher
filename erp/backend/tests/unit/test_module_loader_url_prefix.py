# Regression test for the module-loader URL-prefix derivation.
#
# Background: the recently-added 18 modules were shipped with frontend
# api.ts files that hit hyphenated paths like ``/api/v1/bi-dashboards``
# and ``/api/v1/hse-advanced``. The loader, however, derived the URL
# prefix straight from the Python package directory name (which uses
# underscores), so the frontend got a 404 on every request and the
# pages like /bi-dashboards and /hse-advanced were reported as
# completely broken.
#
# The fix mounts the router on the kebab-cased path AND mirrors it under
# the legacy underscore form. This test pins exactly that: for each real
# module it asserts the loader calls ``include_router`` with BOTH the
# kebab-case prefix and the underscore mirror.
#
# Why we assert on the prefix the loader passes to ``include_router``
# rather than on the routes that end up mounted: the route-transfer step
# (``app.include_router`` iterating ``router.routes`` and re-adding each
# one) hinges on FastAPI's ``isinstance(route, APIRoute)`` check, which
# silently drops every route when the route objects and the app come from
# different copies of the ``fastapi.routing`` module. That class-identity
# split can happen in a worker that has already imported a large slice of
# the app (e.g. one ``pytest-split`` shard that pulled in many modules),
# and it is unrelated to the URL derivation this test exists to guard. The
# prefix passed to ``include_router`` is the actual regression surface, so
# we assert on that and stay immune to the import-identity quirk. Each test
# runs the real loader against the real module in a fresh interpreter.

# Program run in a fresh interpreter. It loads ONE real module through the real
# ModuleLoader (seeding just that module's manifest, so it does not mass-import
# every manifest) and records the prefixes the loader hands to
# ``include_router``. It only imports and mounts routes (no DB connection), so it
# does not need the test database.
