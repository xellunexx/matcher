"""Regression test for DXF arc length — audit C3.

The DXF processor stores arc angles as ``math.radians(dxf.start_angle)``
in :mod:`app.modules.dwg_takeoff.dxf_processor` (see ``_extract_geometry``
ARC branch). Before the fix ``calculate_entity_measurement`` then called
``math.radians()`` a SECOND time on those already-radian values, so the
arc length came out off by ``(π/180)² ≈ 3.05e-4``. A 90° arc was
reported as ~0 metres, and circular features were silently dropped from
takeoff totals.

These tests pin the correct behaviour by feeding the calculator the
geometry it would receive from ``_extract_geometry`` for a 90° arc
of radius 1 — the expected length is ``π/2`` (~1.5708 m). The OLD
buggy result would be ``π/2 × (π/180)² ≈ 4.79e-4 m`` — three orders of
magnitude off — so the assertion below catches a regression decisively.
