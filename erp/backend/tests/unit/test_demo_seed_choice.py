"""Unit tests for the demo-seed choice mechanism (issue #272 / demo sign-in).

These cover the precedence that ``seed_demo_enabled()`` encodes and that both
CLI flags rely on: ``SEED_DEMO`` in the environment wins, then the persisted
``demo_seed_choice.json`` in the data dir, then the out-of-the-box default of
on. ``serve --no-demo`` persists a ``False`` choice; ``serve --demo`` persists
``True`` to clear that opt-out and bring the demo sign-in back.

Pure filesystem + environment, no database, so this runs everywhere.
