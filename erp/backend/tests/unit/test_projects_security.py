# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Hardening tests for the ``projects`` module.

Covers the four security/correctness fixes shipped alongside this file:

1. **Slug collision race** — ``ProjectService._generate_project_code`` is
   serialised by an asyncio.Lock + post-lock collision re-check so two
   concurrent ``create_project`` calls never produce the same code
   (``Project.project_code`` has no DB-level UniqueConstraint).
2. **Currency change ramifications** — ``update_project`` rejects with
   HTTP 409 when the caller flips ``project.currency`` while BOQ
   positions already exist, unless ``metadata.allow_currency_change``
   is True (escape hatch for admins who know what they're doing).
3. **Currency-changed event** — when currency does change, a
   ``projects.project.currency_changed`` event is published so BOQ /
   rollup subscribers can react.
4. **Inactive-user member-add guard** — ``add_project_member`` rejects
   ``is_active=False`` users with HTTP 400 instead of silently creating
   a dangling membership row.

All tests run against an isolated, throwaway PostgreSQL database (cloned from a
schema-loaded template by ``tests._pg.isolated_engine``) so they run fast and
never touch the production database. The fixtures open several independent
sessions from a shared sessionmaker and rely on cross-connection commit
visibility (the concurrent-create test in particular spins up 50 separately
committing sessions), so a real throwaway engine is used rather than a single
savepoint-rolled-back session.
