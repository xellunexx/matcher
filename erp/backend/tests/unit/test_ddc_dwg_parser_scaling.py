"""The vertex rows of a DDC export are read once, not once per polyline.

A 22 MB drawing sat in "converting" for over an hour and was then declared
dead. The DDC subprocess had long finished; the phase that had not was the
xlsx parse, which recovered each polyline's terminal End Point by re-reading
every row of the export once per polyline. That is O(polylines x rows), in
the one phase of the DWG pipeline with no timeout on it.

Wall-clock cannot express that on a shared runner, so these tests count work.
``_parse_coord`` is called three times per vertex row by the collection pass.
A second pass over the vertex rows shows up as a fourth call per row, whatever
the fixture size, so the count is an exact assertion rather than a threshold.

Exact, not ``<=``, deliberately. An upper bound of ``3n`` would be satisfied by
a parser that made the three lookups lazy and then added a second pass back,
which is ``2n``, and that is precisely the regression this file exists to stop.
The cost of exactness is that a genuine optimisation also turns it red: if you
short-circuit ``sp or pt or ep`` and the count drops, lower the constant and
keep the test. A drop is fine. A rise is the bug coming back.

The remaining tests pin the behaviour the collection pass has to preserve,
because a faster parser that loses the tail vertex is not a fix.
