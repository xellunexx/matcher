"""The rating provenance record must not leave the process.

A subcontractor rating stores a ``basis`` column describing how each score was
arrived at. Part of that record, under the ``sources`` key, is a per-metric
{"event": n, "direct": n} pair. The ``direct`` half is a COUNT(*) over the NCR,
safety-incident and schedule tables filtered only by subcontractor and month,
with no project or tenant predicate. Those tables are gated by
verify_project_access when they are read through their own modules.

``basis`` is returned by GET /ratings/, which asks only for subcontractors.read,
the viewer role. So the pair let a viewer read an exact tally of another
tenant's non-conformances and safety incidents.

These tests pin the response schema, not the endpoint, because all three routes
that return a rating go through the same schema and a rule written in one
router would leave the other two open.

Scope, stated so a later reader does not mistake this for the whole fix: the
counters beside ``sources`` are max(accumulated, direct) and the scores are
computed from them, so a narrowed signal remains. Closing that needs a decision
on whether a rating is per project, per tenant or deliberately shared.
