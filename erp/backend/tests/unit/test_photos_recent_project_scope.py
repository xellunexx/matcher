"""Project scoping of the recent-photos feed (``PhotoService.recent_across_projects``).

The dashboard's site-photos card is project facing: clicking a photo selects
that project and opens its gallery. So when a project is selected the card
passes ``project_id`` and the feed has to answer for that project alone.

The filter is applied as an INTERSECTION with the set of projects the caller may
reach, never as a replacement for it. That distinction is the whole point of
these tests. A replacement would let any caller name any project id and receive
its site documentation, which is a read of data they cannot otherwise open; an
intersection can only ever return fewer rows than the unfiltered call, never
different ones.

The estate is built so the intersection has real work to do:

    owned        owner is the caller
    member       owned by a stranger, reachable only through a team membership
    unreachable  owned by a stranger, no membership for the caller

Without the middle one a broken implementation that replaced the accessible set
whenever the caller happened to own the named project would still pass.

Runs on the shared PostgreSQL unit database from ``tests/_pg.py``, inside an
outer transaction rolled back on teardown, which is what the neighbouring
service-level tests use. Foreign keys stay on: the accessible set is resolved
from real ``Project``, ``User``, ``Team`` and ``TeamMembership`` rows, and the
admin branch reads ``User.role`` off the persisted row.

Run:  python -m pytest tests/unit/test_photos_recent_project_scope.py -q
