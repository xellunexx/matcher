"""Where the embedded vector service installs itself.

``app.core.storage.resolve_data_dir`` is documented as the single source of
truth for writable state, and every other component defers to it. The vector
supervisor did not: it took the account's home directory instead.

In a container those are different places. The image points ``OE_DATA_DIR`` at
a mounted volume while the home of the unprivileged account it runs as sits
inside the image, so the downloaded binary and its storage did not survive
recreating the container. Updating therefore looked like the service had
uninstalled itself and was asking to be installed again, which is what issue
#391 reported. Mounting a volume over the home path to make it persist fails
differently: Docker creates a volume for a path the image does not contain as
root-owned, and the unprivileged app cannot write into it.

The migration case matters as much as the fix. An operator who already has a
working install in the old location must keep it rather than be asked to
download the binary a second time.
