"""International-robustness tests for the change-request clarifier (py3.11 pure).

Covers the widened, currency-agnostic cost signal (so a note written anywhere in
the world is read the same way, not only one priced in euros / dollars / pounds)
and the conservative input-size guard on the clarifier request schema.
