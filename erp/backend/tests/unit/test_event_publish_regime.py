"""Guard the synchronous-publish contract unit tests are written against.

``tests/conftest.py`` replaces ``event_bus.publish_detached`` so a test can call
a service and assert on its own recorder on the very next line, with no await in
between. That shim picks its regime from what is on the bus: one subscriber
doing real async I/O pushes the whole publish onto the event loop, and every
pure recorder goes with it.

The first bug this file guards: an earlier test subscribed such a handler and
never unsubscribed, so from that point on every unit test relying on the
synchronous contract asserted against an empty recorder. The symptom appeared in
an unrelated module, hundreds of tests away from the cause, and vanished
whenever that file was run on its own.

The second, worse one: the guard classified handlers against a hand-kept set of
three names, which covered the ``"*"`` subscribers and none of the 150-odd
per-event ones. A leaked ``boq.position.created`` subscriber therefore looked
pure, was stepped by hand, suspended inside a live asyncpg read and corrupted
the session-scoped loop; every later test in the process died in ``selectors.py``
without reaching application code. So the assertions below are written over real
application subscribers from *both* registries, and none of them depends on a
handler's name.

Importing an events module registers its subscribers on the process-global bus -
that is how the module loader wires the app, and it is also the leak class under
test here. The deliberate leaks are removed again at module teardown.
