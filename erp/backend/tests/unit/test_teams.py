"""Database-free tests for :class:`TeamService`'s two authorisation gates.

Scope, and the reason for the split: the behavioural coverage of this module -
what a restriction does, who may write one, what a stranger sees - lives in
``tests/unit/teams/`` against a real PostgreSQL session, because a gate is only
proved by the data it refuses. What is left here is the part that genuinely
does not need a database: how ``_assert_project_admin`` composes the access
check and the ownership check, and that ``add_member`` cannot be reached
without passing both.

Repositories and session are stubbed. ``_assert_project_access`` and
``_is_project_owner_or_admin`` are monkey-patched per test so the composition
can be driven through all four combinations without standing up Project and
User tables. ``_assert_project_admin`` itself is NOT stubbed - it is the thing
under test.
