"""Shared fakes for the saved-views security tests.

Pure-unit fakes so the gate tests run WITHOUT a database: a stub session that
records the SQL it is asked to execute, a tiny seed-row store, and helpers to
build a registered entity against an in-memory toy model. The DB-backed
integration tests use ``tests._pg.transactional_session`` instead and are gated
on a bootable PostgreSQL cluster.
