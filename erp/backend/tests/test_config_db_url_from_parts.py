"""The database URL is assembled from parts without breaking on punctuation.

Issue #404 was an installation that would not come up: the app container exited
on ``socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known`` while PostgreSQL
next to it stayed healthy on the same password. The cause was the URL, not the
network. A compose file interpolates the password straight into

    postgresql+asyncpg://oe:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/openestimate

and a URL splits its user info at the *first* ``@``, so the password ``pa@ss``
makes the host ``ss@postgres``. PostgreSQL never noticed because it receives
the password as a plain environment variable, where ``@`` means nothing.

Compose has no urlencode, so the assembly moved into ``Settings``, which sees
the parts while they are still separate. These tests pin the behaviour that
matters: whatever the password contains, the host stays the host and the
password survives the round trip.
