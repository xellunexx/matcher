"""The module's declared vocabularies, checked against their sources of truth.

``VALIDATION_STATUSES`` is not a choice this module gets to make. The write is
``row.validation_status = report.status.value`` in ``_apply_report``, so the set
of values that can reach the column is decided by
``app.core.validation.engine.ValidationStatus``, one import away. The tuple was
missing ``unsupported`` until this file was written, and ``unsupported`` is
precisely the status the engine returns when the ``full_evm`` rule set resolves
to no rules, so the one value that reports a broken registration was the one
value the module said could not occur.

The honest scope of that bug: nothing imports the tuple, and both schemas type
the field as a plain ``str``, so no write was ever refused and no response ever
failed. What was wrong was the module's own published description of its column,
in a name it exports. That is worth being right, and it is worth having a check,
because the reason it stayed wrong is that no code disagreed with it.

Which is also why every assertion below names something outside this module -
the engine's enum, the mapped columns, the writer function. Checking the tuple
against itself, or against string literals repeated in a fixture, would have
agreed with the bug at every step.

``schemas.py`` pins the module's three other vocabularies to their ``Literal``
restatements via ``_check_vocabulary`` at import time. That mechanism does not
fit here, because this tuple is deliberately *not* equal to the enum: it carries
the extra ``pending`` that the column defaults to and the engine can never
produce. The relationship is a superset with one named exception, so it is
spelled out here instead.
