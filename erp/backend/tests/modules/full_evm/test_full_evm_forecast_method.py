"""Forecast-method provenance on the legacy snapshot-derived surface.

``EVMService.calculate_forecast`` used to accept any string as a method and
quietly treat everything it did not recognise as the cost-trend formula. It
also fell back to remaining-as-planned whenever CPI was zero - the normal state
of a project that has earned nothing yet - while still recording the requested
method on the row. The number was therefore produced by one formula and
labelled with another, and the standard EAC formulas disagree by design.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix: an unknown method is rejected, and
whenever a fallback happens the row says so.

Driven through a stub session in the style of ``tests/unit/test_full_evm_service.py``
so the arithmetic under test is not hidden behind database setup.
