"""Round-trip test for the Full EVM register migration.

A migration nobody has run is a guess. This drives the real ``upgrade()`` and
``downgrade()`` of ``v3264_full_evm_baseline_register`` against a throwaway
PostgreSQL database and checks the three properties the project asks of every
migration: it chains off an existing revision, it is idempotent, and its
downgrade actually reverses it rather than being a ``pass``.

The throwaway database is cloned from the session schema template, so it starts
with the tables already present - which is precisely the state that makes a
non-idempotent ``upgrade()`` blow up on an install that ran ``create_all``.

Migration files are loaded from disk by path: ``alembic/versions`` is a script
directory, not an importable package, and the installed ``alembic`` library
shadows the name.
