"""The running application loads the full_evm rules, not just this test package.

``conftest.py`` registers the rule set by hand for every test here, and says why
in as many words: the application does it from ``on_startup``, which no test
process runs. That fixture is correct and should stay, but it means every other
test in this package would go on passing if the ``on_startup`` wiring were
deleted tomorrow. The suite would be measuring its own fixture.

So this file empties the rule set first, boots the application the way production
boots it, with the module loader walking the manifests and calling each package's
``on_startup``, and only then asks what the registry holds. Emptying is the load
bearing step: the rules are also registered as a side effect of importing
``validators``, and this process has certainly imported it by now, so a check
that skipped it would pass either way.

The stakes are in ``test_full_evm_vocabulary.py``: when this rule set resolves to
nothing, the engine does not raise, it returns a clean report with status
``unsupported``, and ``_apply_report`` writes that onto every baseline and
measurement it touches. A lost registration is therefore silent at the point of
failure and only visible in a column nobody reads.
