    The application registers these from the module ``on_startup`` hook, which
    no test process runs. Without this the core engine would report the rule
    set as *unsupported* and hand back a clean report - indistinguishable from
    the rules having run and found nothing, which is exactly the false pass
    these tests exist to rule out.

    No teardown: registration is idempotent (the registry keys rules by id) and
    leaving the set in place cannot make another suite fail, whereas tearing it
    down mid-session could.
