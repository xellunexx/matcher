"""The declared loading strategy on every formwork relationship.

Per ``.claude/rules/backend-modules.md`` a green test lane is NOT evidence that
a loading strategy is right - a lane that never walks the relationship passes
whatever the strategy is. These tests walk each one deliberately:

* ``FormworkAssignment.schedule_lines`` is ``selectin``, so it must be
  populated on an instance the session just loaded, with no further SQL.
* ``FormworkScheduleLine.assignment`` and ``FormworkAssignment.system`` are
  ``raise_on_sql``, so touching them on an instance loaded alone must raise
  with the relationship named, and must NOT raise when the parent was already
  brought in eagerly. That difference is the whole reason the policy says
  ``raise_on_sql`` rather than ``raise``.
* ``cascade="all, delete-orphan"`` on ``schedule_lines`` still deletes the
  children even though the collection is walked through a strategy that
  refuses ad-hoc SQL.
