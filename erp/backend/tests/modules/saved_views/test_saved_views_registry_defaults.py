"""``default_columns`` has to resolve, or a run silently returns fewer columns.

A spec that names its own columns is checked by ``FilterSpec.bind``. The
default set is not: it is read straight out of the registration when a spec
asks for no columns, and ``_serialize_row`` drops a name it cannot resolve
without a word. The result is a response short a column and a CSV export whose
header carries a cell that is always empty - the kind of wrong that nobody
reports because it looks like missing data.

The registration is therefore where it has to fail, and it has to fail the boot
rather than a request: an entity is registered once at startup, so a bad
default column that only surfaced on use would sit there for a release.

These tests use the real registry and clear only the entity they registered, so
they cannot disturb the built-in registrations another module test relies on.
