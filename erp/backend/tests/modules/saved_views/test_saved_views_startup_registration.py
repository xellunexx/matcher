"""The running application loads the saved-views rules, not just the tests.

A rule registered at import time is registered the moment anything in the test
process imports the module that defines it - including a fixture, a conftest, or
an unrelated test that pulled in the service. A suite can therefore be entirely
green over a module whose rules the real application never loads at all, because
the tests did the registration the application was supposed to do.

So this file does not ask "are the rules registered". It empties the rule set
first, boots the application the way it boots in production - the module loader
walking the manifests and calling each package's ``on_startup`` - and then asks
whether they came back. If the only registration route were the import that has
already happened, they would not.
