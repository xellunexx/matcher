"""``v3267_saved_views_team_share`` runs, reverses and re-runs on PostgreSQL.

Every other test in this directory builds its schema through
``Base.metadata.create_all``, so none of them executes a single line of the
migration. "Idempotent" and "has a real downgrade" would therefore stay claims
rather than results, and the three CHECK constraints go in as raw ``ALTER
TABLE`` strings that PostgreSQL would only parse the first time somebody
actually migrated a database.

The cycle run here is stamp-behind, upgrade, downgrade, upgrade:

1. A throwaway database cloned from the schema template already carries
   everything the migration adds, because ``create_all`` built it. Stamping it
   one revision behind and upgrading has to change nothing - that is the
   idempotency claim, tested against exactly the schema a fresh install has.
2. Downgrading has to remove the column, its index, its foreign key and the
   three constraints, and leave the rest of the table alone.
3. Upgrading again has to put them back through the raw DDL path, under the
   same names ``create_all`` produces. A name that only matches one of the two
   routes into this schema is a constraint nobody can drop.

The constraints are then shown to reject the rows they exist to reject, so a
constraint that was created but written wrong cannot pass as a working one.
