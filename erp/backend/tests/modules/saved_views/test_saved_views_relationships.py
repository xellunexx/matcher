"""The declared loading strategy on both saved-views relationships.

Per ``.claude/rules/backend-modules.md`` a green test lane is NOT evidence that
a loading strategy is right - a lane that never walks the relationship passes
whatever the strategy is. These tests walk both of them deliberately.

Run history is unbounded and is not what a caller listing or executing a view
wants, so ``SavedView.runs`` is ``raise_on_sql`` rather than ``selectin``, and
``SavedViewRun.view`` is ``raise_on_sql`` because the FK column already carries
the id. The point of ``raise_on_sql`` over ``raise`` is that it still allows the
free read off an instance that was loaded eagerly, so both halves of that are
checked here: the refusal when SQL would fire, and the read that costs nothing.

The aggregates in the repository exist precisely because the collection refuses
ad-hoc SQL, so they are exercised against the same rows.
