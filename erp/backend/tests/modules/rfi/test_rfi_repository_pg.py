"""Wave 8 (Tests) - RFI repository SQL coverage (real PostgreSQL).

The in-memory stub repos the unit suites use cannot exercise the actual SQL in
``RFIRepository`` - the ``next_rfi_number`` MAX(cast(...)) aggregate with its
``RFI-[0-9]+`` regexp guard, and the ILIKE free-text ``list_for_project``
search. Both have real correctness requirements that only PostgreSQL can prove:

* ``next_rfi_number`` must format ``RFI-NNN`` zero-padded to 3 digits, scope to
  one project, and skip non-canonical (legacy / externally-numbered) rows so a
  single odd row does not break numbering for the whole project (the cast would
  otherwise raise on PostgreSQL).
* ``list_for_project`` search must match across subject / question /
  official_response / rfi_number, be case-insensitive, and stay project-scoped.
* ``with_total=False`` must skip the COUNT and still return a coherent tuple.

DB-backed; runs in CI against the shared ``oe_test_unit`` database inside a
transaction rolled back on teardown (``tests._pg``).
