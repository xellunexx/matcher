"""``POST /schedule-advanced/{id}/level-resources`` levels the whole logic.

The endpoint used to run an FS-only leveler while ``/level-preview`` and
``/level-apply`` already ran the engine that honours all four PDM link types.
A schedule built on SS, FF or SF therefore came back from this one endpoint
with starts that break its own logic, and nothing in the response said so: the
shifts look exactly like shifts computed correctly.

These tests pin the two halves. First that the defect was real, by running both
levelers over the same SS network and showing the old one violating the link
the new one respects. Then that the endpoint is on the new engine, by calling
the handler with the rows it would have read and checking the answer.

The handler is exercised directly with a stub session rather than over HTTP:
what is under test is which arithmetic it runs, and the auth and loading it
does around that are covered where they are defined.
