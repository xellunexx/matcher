"""Integration tests for the phone-log capture service (#23).

PostgreSQL, py3.12. ``create_phone_log`` runs the pure ``phonelog.normalize``
engine and persists a canonical row; these tests seed real projects and assert
the stored record (direction, channel, parties, duration, summary, instructions,
word_count, occurred_at) plus list scoping / filtering / ordering and single-row
fetch, and that the router's response mapping round-trips the row.

Under tests/modules (the single non-sharded job) so adding them never reshuffles
the pytest-split unit shards.
