"""Positive control: the design_options rule set is really registered.

Every other validation test in this suite is only meaningful when the six rules
are in the process-global registry. When they are not, the engine resolves
``design_options`` as an unsupported rule set, runs nothing, and returns a clean
report - which reads exactly like "the rules ran and found no problem". These
tests fail loudly in that situation so the rest of the suite cannot quietly
degrade into proving nothing.
