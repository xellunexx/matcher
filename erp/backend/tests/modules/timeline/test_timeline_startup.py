"""What the running app loads at startup, not what the fixtures load.

The credentials module shipped with validation rules that ``on_startup`` never
registered. Its conftest registered them by hand, so seventy-two tests ran
against a rule set that did not exist in the running application and every one
of them passed. That is the most expensive shape of bug available here, because
the test suite actively conceals it.

So these assertions are made against ``on_startup`` itself with both registrars
monkeypatched. The suite's own fixture registering the rules cannot make them
pass, and removing either call from the hook fails them.
