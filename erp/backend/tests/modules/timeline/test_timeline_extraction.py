"""Entity-id and actor extraction, checked against real publisher payloads.

The payload key lists here are read out of ``app/`` with :mod:`ast` rather than
typed into the test. That is not tidiness: an earlier draft of this check typed
the keys for ``correspondence.outbound.requested`` from memory, invented a
``project_id`` it does not send, and reported the event as routable when it is
not. A payload shape a test imagines is a payload shape nothing publishes.
