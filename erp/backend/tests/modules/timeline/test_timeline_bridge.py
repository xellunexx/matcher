"""The event-bus bridge: which events become rows, and what those rows carry.

``_record_event`` opens its own session through ``async_session_factory``,
which the rolled-back test session cannot intercept. These tests therefore
drive the mapping and the write decision directly and assert on the row the
bridge would build, rather than committing to the shared database from a
detached session and leaking rows into every later test.
