"""W22 audit follow-up — diary delete happy-path + immutability gate.

The W22 sweep flagged ``daily_diary.delete_diary`` as orphan: the
backend endpoint and service method existed, the frontend exposed
``deleteDiary(id)`` in api.ts, but no UI surface was wired and no test
exercised the full create → delete → 404 round trip.

This module pins the contract:

1. **Happy path** — an open diary can be deleted by a user holding
   ``daily_diary.delete``; the service runs cleanly and a subsequent
   ``get_diary`` raises 404 (``diary_not_found``). Mirrors the
   ``DELETE /diaries/{id}`` → 204 + GET → 404 sequence the new UI
   confirm-dialog exercises.

2. **Sealed-immutable** — once signed (or archived) the same call
   surfaces 409 with the structured ``diary_signed_immutable`` code,
   matching the rest of the daily-diary write-gate (parity with
   ``update_diary`` / ``create_entry`` / ``register_photo``).
