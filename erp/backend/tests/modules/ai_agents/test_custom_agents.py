"""Custom (user-authored) AI agents — service + run-path lifecycle.

Exercises the custom-agent feature end to end against a transaction-isolated
PostgreSQL session (rolled back on teardown), never the production DB and
without the slow full-app lifespan:

* the guided builder spec compiles into a coherent system prompt;
* AgentService creates / lists / resolves / updates / deletes custom agents;
* per-user ownership: another user cannot resolve/get/update/delete them;
* a custom agent runs through the SAME AgentRunner loop as the built-ins
  (via AgentService.start_run with an injected ScriptedLLM) and the run row
  reaches status=completed with the scripted answer;
* a custom agent's run name is the ``custom:<id>`` slug round-tripped on the
  persisted AgentRun.

The LLM is a ScriptedLLM, so no external provider is contacted.
