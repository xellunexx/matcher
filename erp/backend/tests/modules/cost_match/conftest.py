"""Shared fixtures for the cost_match database-backed suites.

The app is booted once for the whole package rather than once per module:
standing it up is the expensive part of these tests, and both the service-level
and the HTTP-level suites need the same thing from it (the schema, an
authenticated admin, and the module's routes mounted).

A cost base is seeded under its own ``region`` tag so retrieval in these tests
can never reach a row some other suite left behind, and so the tests can assert
on an exact candidate pool.
