"""Service-level tests for ``BIMHubService.ensure_tileset``.

Exercises the bake orchestration end to end against the real storage backend
and DB session (no HTTP / auth - that is the endpoint's job): a model's
monolithic GLB is baked into tiles, the manifest + tiles land in storage, a
second call reuses the cache without re-baking, and a re-converted model
(changed source fingerprint) transparently re-bakes.
