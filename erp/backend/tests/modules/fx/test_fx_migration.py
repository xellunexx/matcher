"""Executes the FX migration in both directions against real PostgreSQL.

Reading a migration proves nothing about it. The two claims worth checking are
the two that only show up in production: that ``upgrade()`` is a no-op against a
database that already carries the tables (this platform materialises schema with
``create_all`` and then stamps, so the very first thing the migration meets is a
database that does not need it), and that ``downgrade()`` genuinely reverses it
rather than being the ``pass`` that so many downgrades quietly are.

The migration is driven directly through an Alembic ``MigrationContext`` instead
of ``alembic upgrade head``, so that what is under test is this revision's own
SQL rather than the state of the graph around it.

That choice used to be excused here by the claim that the graph had several
independent heads and no linear run reached this revision. The claim was
accurate, and it was describing a bug rather than a quirk. This revision names
``v3234_cost_search_trgm`` as its parent, a node ``v3250_merge_open_heads`` had
already folded into the mainline, so it sat alone on a second head and
``alembic upgrade head`` refused to run at all. Since this file is the only
one that creates the three tables below, every install built by migrations
instead of ``create_all`` was missing the whole rate register.
``v3268_merge_fx_branch`` folds the branch back in, and
``tests/unit/test_alembic_single_head.py`` now fails if any revision opens a
second head again. Whether this revision is reachable is that test's job, and
deliberately not this one's.

Everything runs against a throwaway database from ``isolated_engine()``, which
is cloned per test and dropped afterwards. The shared unit database is off
limits for this - dropping tables in it would take down every other test in the
session.
