"""The running application loads the fx rules, not just this test package.

``conftest.py`` registers the rule set by hand for every test here and states the
reason plainly: the application registers them from ``on_startup``, which no test
process runs, so without the fixture the ``fx`` set would resolve to zero rules
and the engine would report it unsupported, which is indistinguishable from the
rules running and finding nothing. The fixture is right to exist. The cost is
that every other test in this package would keep passing if the ``on_startup``
wiring were removed, because the fixture would go on doing the application's job.

This file closes that gap. It empties the rule set, boots the application the way
production boots it, with the module loader walking manifests and calling each
package's ``on_startup``, and then asks the registry what came back. Emptying
first is what makes the answer mean anything: the rules are also registered as a
side effect of importing ``validators``, which this process has certainly done.

For fx the damage from a lost registration is quieter than a crash. The report is
what tells an estimator that the project's reporting currency is not quoted by
the set it prices against, or that a pinned set was left unlocked. With no rules
registered that report comes back clean, and the figures it was supposed to
question ship looking checked.
