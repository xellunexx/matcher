"""The register's whole reason to exist: a credential that ages out.

Nothing writes to a credential row as it ages. It is created once, and then the
calendar moves. Every query that trusts the stored ``status`` column therefore
misses exactly the rows the register exists to surface - the ones that quietly
became someone else's problem overnight.

These tests plant rows whose stored status is what it would have been on the day
they were entered, then ask the register what it says today. A stored status is
never used as the expected value; the expectation is always derived from the
dates, because the dates are the thing that is true.
