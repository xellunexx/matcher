"""Shared fixtures for the credentials registry test suite.

The session fixture runs against the shared PostgreSQL unit database from
``tests/_pg.py``, inside an outer transaction rolled back on teardown.

Foreign keys stay on: the module's access guard resolves real ``User`` and
``Project`` rows, and the requirement table's delete cascade is a database-level
``ON DELETE CASCADE`` from the project that never fires with the replication
role set.

Dates are always expressed relative to ``today`` through :func:`day`. A test
that hard-coded a calendar date would pass until that date drifted into the
past, and a register whose entire subject is expiry is the worst possible place
for a test that silently changes meaning over time.

The module's seven validation rules are registered here. The application does
that from its ``on_startup`` hook, which no test process runs, so without this
the ``credentials`` rule set resolves to zero rules and the engine reports it
as unsupported - which is indistinguishable from "the rules ran and found
nothing".
