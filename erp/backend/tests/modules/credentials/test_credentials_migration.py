"""The schema is built two ways, and both ways must agree.

A fresh install gets its tables from ``Base.metadata.create_all``; an existing
deployment gets them from the migration. Every other test in this package runs
against the first path only, so the migration could be wrong in any way at all -
a missed index, a nullable column that should not be, a constraint under a name
nothing matches - and the suite would stay green right up until someone upgraded
a production database.

These tests apply the migration for real, to a throwaway database, and compare
the schema it produces against the schema the models produce. They also hold it
to the two properties claimed in its docstring: applying it to a database that
already has the table is a no-op, and the downgrade genuinely reverses it.
