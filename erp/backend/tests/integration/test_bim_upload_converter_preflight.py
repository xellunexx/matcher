"""Integration tests for the BIM upload converter preflight.

Covers:
    * Test A — ``.rvt`` upload with no converter installed → 202 with
      ``status="converter_required"``, the upload **persisted** and a
      placeholder model row created.
    * Test B — ``.ifc`` upload must NOT be blocked by preflight even
      when ``find_converter`` returns ``None``, because IFC has a
      built-in text fallback parser.
    * Test C — ``.rvt`` upload with a (mocked) installed converter →
      preflight passes; post-processing ends up in ``needs_converter``
      or ``error`` (both acceptable — the point is preflight did not
      short-circuit).
    * Test D — success-path response shape must include the new
      ``error_message``, ``converter_id`` and ``install_endpoint``
      fields introduced in v1.4.7.

Two contract changes have landed since this file was written for v1.4.7
and Test A / Test C now assert the current behaviour instead:

    * ``f58d36fab`` (v2.6.28, "BUG-RVT03/04 — converter_required upload
      now persists file + 202 Accepted") turned the missing-converter
      response from "refuse and keep nothing" into "save the upload,
      create a ``needs_converter`` model row, answer 202 Accepted". Test
      A used to assert ``model_id is None`` / ``name is None`` /
      ``file_size == 0``; that "nothing was persisted" contract is gone
      deliberately, because re-uploading a 500 MB model after running
      the converter install is worse than re-processing a saved one.
    * ``f6d8e50f1`` (v1.9.6/v1.9.7) added ``app/core/file_signature.py``
      and wired ``ALLOWED_CAD_TYPES`` into this upload route, so the
      payload now has to look like the format it claims to be. Test C's
      old fixture (1 KB of zero bytes) is not an RVT and is rejected
      with 400 before the mocked converter is ever consulted, so it now
      uses ``_MINIMAL_RVT`` instead.

The module-scoped client + auth fixtures follow the same pattern as
``test_requirements_bim_cross.py`` — a full app lifespan (so
``module_loader.load_all`` runs) and a freshly registered admin.
