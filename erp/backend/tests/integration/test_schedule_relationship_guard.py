"""Regression: relationship create + predecessor completion guard.

Two behaviours, both introduced with the dependency-unification work and both
only reproducible against a real (async) database, so they run against an
isolated throwaway PostgreSQL (``tests._pg.transactional_session``) rather than
a fake/in-memory session:

1. ``create_relationship`` must not raise. The handler rebuilds the successor's
   derived ``dependencies`` JSON mirror after inserting the edge, and that
   rebuild calls ``session.expire_all()``. Serialising the freshly-inserted
   ``ScheduleRelationship`` *after* the expire triggered an implicit async
   refresh from Pydantic's synchronous attribute access, which raised
   ``MissingGreenlet`` and surfaced as a 500. The fix snapshots the response
   model before the mirror rebuild. A fake session cannot reproduce the
   greenlet error, so the guard exercises the real handler against the real
   engine.

2. An activity cannot be marked complete while a canonical predecessor is still
   open: ``update_progress`` raises 409 naming the blocking predecessor, and
   succeeds once the predecessor is completed.
