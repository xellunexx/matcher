"""Test-only helpers for promoting a freshly registered user to admin.

The public `/auth/register` endpoint intentionally demotes new users to
``viewer`` (security hardening, BUG-327/386). Integration tests need admin
privileges, so they register a user and then promote them via a direct DB
write — bypassing the HTTP surface entirely.

    Originally this only flipped ``role``, which sufficed in v2.5.x when
    ``open`` was the default registration mode and every newly-registered
    account was already active. v2.5.2 flipped the default mode to
    ``admin-approve`` (BUG-RBAC03), so non-bootstrap registrations now
    land with ``is_active=False`` and login returns the same generic
    "Invalid email or password" error as a wrong password — silently
    breaking every shared_auth fixture that promotes after register.
    Setting ``is_active=True`` here keeps test fixtures working in both
    legacy and current registration modes.
