"""End-to-end SSE rendering regression for GitHub issue #138 / task #249.

Issue #138 — "Chat IA no responde"
==================================
A user connected an OpenRouter LLM key. The OpenRouter dashboard showed
real token consumption (136 requests, 6.41M tokens) — proving the backend
reached the provider and the completion was billed — yet **no response
text ever appeared** in the OpenConstructionERP chat UI.

Two independent v3.6.1 defects produced that exact "tokens spent, UI
empty" symptom (both fixed by task #249, both pinned here):

1. ``_RejectNonFiniteJSONMiddleware.replay()`` returned a synthetic
   ``{"type": "http.disconnect"}`` on its second ``receive()`` call.
   Starlette's ``StreamingResponse`` runs ``listen_for_disconnect``
   concurrently with the body generator; the fake disconnect made that
   watcher return instantly and **cancel the SSE stream before a single
   byte was written** — HTTP 200 with a 0-byte body. The OpenRouter call
   still completed (it is ``await``-ed *inside* the generator before the
   first ``yield``), so tokens were billed while the UI got nothing.
2. The v3.6.1 frontend parser only read ``data:`` lines and switched on a
   non-existent ``chunk.type`` field. The backend ``_sse()`` puts the
   event name on a separate ``event:`` line and the payload carries NO
   ``type`` field, so even an intact stream rendered zero text.

Why this file exists
====================
``test_issue_138_model_override.py`` pins the *model-id* half of #138.
But the bug report's evidence (6.41M tokens billed across 136 requests)
proves the calls *succeeded* — a wrong/unfunded model would have errored,
not billed. The unrendered-completion failure was never covered
end-to-end. This suite drives the **real FastAPI app with the full
middleware stack** (incl. ``_RejectNonFiniteJSONMiddleware`` and the
``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` chain), a configured **OpenRouter** provider, and
a faithful port of the production ``useChatFullPage.ts`` SSE parser, then
asserts the assistant text actually renders for OpenRouter-shaped
responses — including OpenRouter's real quirks (multiline content,
reasoning-only completions).

A v3.6.1 backend would fail ``test_*_streams_nonzero_body`` (0-byte
body). A v3.6.1 frontend parser would fail ``test_*_renders_in_ui``.

No network: ``httpx.AsyncClient.post`` is monkeypatched to return canned
OpenRouter-shaped bodies. The test runs on the PostgreSQL cluster that
``conftest`` provisions and binds before any test module imports — the
production database is never touched.
