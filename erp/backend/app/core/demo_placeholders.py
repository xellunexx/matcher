"""On-demand placeholder file generation for demo and mirror records.

Why this exists
---------------
Demo and showcase projects ship without the multi-megabyte binaries the
records reference (we do not bundle DWG/IFC/PDF blobs in the wheel), and
/files mirror documents can point at another module's upload whose blob
has been pruned. Rather than serve a raw 404 for those rows, the download
routes materialize a small but structurally valid file of the correct type
on first access, so every /files row downloads something openable.

Every writer here:

* writes only to a caller-supplied target path (the route is responsible
  for keeping that path inside a safe, owned directory),
* creates the parent directory if needed,
* produces a non-empty, type-correct file,
* degrades to a plain-text note if an optional library is unavailable.

The functions are intentionally dependency-light and synchronous; callers
run them off the event loop only if they are already in async context and
care about the (tiny) write latency.
