"""CSV / spreadsheet formula-injection neutralisation.

Spreadsheet applications (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) interpret
any cell whose textual value begins with ``=``, ``+``, ``-``, ``@``, a tab
(``\\t``) or a carriage return (``\\r``) as a *formula*. A malicious user
who controls a string field that later flows into an export - a BOQ
position description, a takeoff annotation, a project name - can store a
value like::

    =cmd|'/c calc'!A0

When a colleague opens the exported ``.csv`` / ``.xlsx`` Excel will execute
the formula. Depending on the user's macro / DDE settings this ranges from
"phishing-quality misleading content" to outright RCE
(`CVE-2014-3524 <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection>`_).

The OWASP-recommended fix is **output-side neutralisation**: when writing a
cell value, if the string starts with one of the dangerous characters,
prepend a single apostrophe (``'``). Excel hides that apostrophe in the
rendered cell but treats the remaining content as literal text.

We deliberately do *not* mutate the data at rest - sanitising on read /
write of the database would corrupt legitimate formula-prefixed text and
break round-trips for CSVs that the user explicitly wants to re-import. The
defence belongs at the export boundary.

Usage::

    from app.core.csv_safety import neutralise_formula

    writer.writerow([neutralise_formula(pos.description), ...])
    ws.cell(row=r, column=c, value=neutralise_formula(pos.description))

Numbers, ``Decimal``, ``None`` and other non-string types pass through
unchanged - they cannot be misinterpreted as formulae by the spreadsheet
software.

# Characters that trigger formula evaluation when they appear as the first

    Only ``str`` values are modified, and only when the first character is

    arbitrary objects) is returned unchanged so the caller can apply this
    helper unconditionally to every cell.
