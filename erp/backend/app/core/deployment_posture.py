"""Pure builder for the in-product Data & Security posture (#4).

No I/O and no settings access: the caller resolves every fact (deployment mode,
whether an external database is configured, which AI providers are present) and
hands them in as primitives. That keeps this unit-testable on its own and means
it can never accidentally read or echo a secret - it only ever receives provider
*names*, never keys. The HTTP endpoint in :mod:`app.main` is a thin wrapper that
resolves those inputs and calls :func:`build_data_security_posture`.
