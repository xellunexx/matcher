"""Core email abstractions.

Defines the ``EmailMessage`` value object and the ``EmailBackend`` protocol
that every concrete backend (console, smtp, noop, memory) must satisfy.

Backends are intentionally small - a single async ``send`` method - so new
transports (SES, SendGrid, Mailgun, …) can be added as plugins without
touching call sites.  Everything above the backend (template rendering,
retries, logging, settings) lives in ``service.py``.

The backend API is *advisory* about failure: ``send`` returns a
``DeliveryResult`` with ``ok`` plus a structured reason instead of raising.
That lets the service layer log every attempt uniformly and lets callers
decide whether a failed notification is fatal (rare - most emails are
"nice to have" beside a persisted state change).

    ``application/pdf``.

            ``EmailMessage`` objects if you need to fan out, so per-recipient
            delivery status stays independent.
        subject: Pre-rendered subject line. Templates produce this.
        html_body: Rendered HTML body. Plain-text is derived by the SMTP
            backend when needed (strip tags + entities).
        from_addr: Optional ``From:`` override. Falls back to
            ``settings.smtp_from`` in the SMTP backend.
        reply_to: Optional ``Reply-To:`` header.
        headers: Extra headers (e.g. ``List-Unsubscribe``). Keys are
            case-insensitive per RFC 5322.
        tags: Free-form labels for observability (``["password_reset"]``).
            Used by the console backend for pretty-printing and carried
            through to structured logs.
        attachments: Optional binary attachments. Only the SMTP backend
            materialises them into MIME parts; the console / memory / noop
            backends simply note them (they never actually deliver).
