"""High-level helpers around the JobRun row - RFC 34 §4 W0.1.

This module is the API surface every other Wave (CDE upload pipeline,
BIM diff engine, EAC validator, QTO export, …) talks to:

* ``register_handler(kind, handler)`` - module bootstrap registers its
  background work by ``kind`` here.
* ``submit_job(kind, payload, idempotency_key=...)`` - endpoint code
  enqueues a background task and gets back a JobRun row whose ``id``
  the client can poll.
* ``update_progress(job_run_id, percent, message)`` - handlers report
  progress as they run.

The split keeps the Celery transport (``app.core.jobs``,
``app.core.jobs_tasks``) decoupled from business code - handlers never
import Celery directly.

Idempotency contract
--------------------
``idempotency_key`` is a UNIQUE column on ``oe_job_run``. We enforce
de-duplication in two layers:

1. Optimistic SELECT first: lookup by key, return existing row if found.
2. Pessimistic INSERT: race losers will trip the UNIQUE constraint, and
   we then re-read to return the winner's row.

This double-check pattern handles the inevitable race between two
concurrent callers without a serialisable transaction.

    Raises :class:`BrokerUnavailableError` when the broker (Redis) is not

    event loop on kombu's connection-retry loop (the no-Docker dev env has
    no Redis). A cheap pre-flight ping (short timeout, zero retries) detects
    the missing broker fast; ``apply_async`` itself would otherwise also
    stall on the result backend's much longer retry policy.

    Celery itself is an OPTIONAL extra (``celery[redis]`` - see
    ``[project.optional-dependencies]``): the default ``pip install`` and
    the shipped wheel run the lightweight, Redis-optional deploy without it.
    So the transport imports below can raise :class:`ImportError` /
    ``ModuleNotFoundError``; that is treated exactly like an unreachable
    broker (raise :class:`BrokerUnavailableError`) so ``submit_job`` runs the
    job in-process instead of failing the request with a 500. Without this
