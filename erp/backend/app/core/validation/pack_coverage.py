"""Rule-pack coverage resolver - honest "declared vs implemented" accounting.

Background
----------
Each shipped pack under ``packs/<slug>/src/openconstructionerp_*/rule_packs/``
carries one or more ``*.json`` rule-pack files. Every such file lists an
``enables_rule_ids`` array - a set of validation rule ids the pack intends to
switch on (e.g. ``masterformat.division_code_valid``,
``cpwd.item_code_format_chapter_section_item``).

Those JSON files are **declarations only**. Inspected across the whole repo
they contain *no* executable predicate: no ``expression`` / ``assert`` /
``forEach`` block, no ``field`` + ``operator`` + ``value`` triple, no regex,
no threshold. The pack-level ``parameters`` / ``metadata`` blocks are reference
data (consistency classes, pour-speed tables, code references), not per-rule
logic. So a declared rule id only ever "runs" when a hand-written
:class:`~app.core.validation.engine.ValidationRule` (or a compiled
:mod:`~app.core.validation.dsl` rule) with that exact ``rule_id`` is registered
in the engine's :data:`~app.core.validation.engine.rule_registry`.

The validation engine already no-ops an unknown *rule set* honestly
(``RuleRegistry.resolve_rule_sets`` -> ``unsupported_rule_sets``,
``ValidationStatus.UNSUPPORTED``). What was missing is the same honesty one
level down, at the *rule id* granularity the packs declare: out of the ~1440
rule ids the packs advertise, only the subset that maps to a registered rule
body actually executes. Without surfacing that split, a counter or report that
echoes a pack's ``enables_rule_ids`` would over-claim coverage - implying every
declared rule validates when most do not.

What this module does (and deliberately does NOT do)
----------------------------------------------------
This resolver reads the pack JSON files and, for each declared rule id, asks
the live ``rule_registry`` whether a real rule body exists for it. It returns a
clear split:

* ``implemented`` - the rule id resolves to a registered, executing rule.
* ``declared_only`` - the rule id is declared by the pack but has NO
  implementation; it would never run and must be reported as "not run", never
  as a silent pass.

It does **not** synthesise rules, does **not** register anything, and does
**not** touch the engine, the registry, or any existing behaviour. Faking
execution for a rule that carries no machine-readable condition is exactly the
"looks validated, isn't" failure mode we refuse to ship - so when the data has
no predicate, we report the truth instead of inventing one.

The result is plain data (dataclasses + dicts) so an API / UI / report layer
can show "12 of 28 rules implemented" instead of a misleading "28 rules".
Everything is lazy and cached; nothing here runs at import time.
