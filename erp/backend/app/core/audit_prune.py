"""Audit-log PII pruning task (Epic H §H8).

GDPR Article 5(1)(e) - storage limitation. The capture-context columns
added in Epic H (``ip_address`` / ``user_agent``) are personal data even
when the actor cannot be re-identified by name (e.g. a leaked IP can be
tied to a household). To stay compliant we MUST scrub those two columns
on rows older than the configured retention window without dropping the
audit row itself - the rest of the row (entity_type, action, from/to
status, …) is operational data the customer needs for FIDIC / SCL
dispute timelines and stays untouched.

The function is exposed as both a plain async coroutine (for unit tests
and ad-hoc CLI invocation) and as a Celery task (for production beat
scheduling once Celery beat is wired up). Both code paths share
:func:`_prune_query`, which is the only place that touches the database.
