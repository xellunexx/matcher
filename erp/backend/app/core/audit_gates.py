"""Generalised transition-gate registry (Epic H).

The CDE ISO 19650 workflow uses a "Gate B" check on the
SHARED → PUBLISHED transition: the request body MUST carry a non-empty
``approver_signature``. Lots of other FSM transitions in the codebase
want the same shape of precondition (e.g. RFI close with a "resolution
summary", change order approve with a signed PDF reference) - Epic H
extracts the check into a tiny registry so future gates can be added
declaratively without sprinkling more bespoke ``if`` blocks across the
service layer.

The registry is intentionally minimal: each gate is a pure function
``(payload) -> tuple[bool, str | None]`` returning ``(False, "reason")``
when the gate refuses and ``(True, None)`` when it lets the transition
through. The CDE service keeps its existing 400-error contract - the
registry helper raises an ``HTTPException(status_code=400)`` on failure
so caller code paths stay byte-identical.

# with a precise message in the negative path.
