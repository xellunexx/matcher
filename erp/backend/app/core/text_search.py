"""Free-text matching for catalogue pickers.

A picker filter built as one ``ILIKE '%<whole query>%'`` answers a question
nobody asks. Estimators type the words that tell entries apart, not a prefix
of the stored string, and in a structured catalogue those words sit at the
tail of the position text and are separated by words the typist skips. A
Swiss civil-works catalogue reported in issue #406 has five positions whose
common head is "Installation de chantier" and whose tails are "chantier
moyen, grue a tour" and friends; typing ``grue tour`` matched nothing at all,
because that substring does not occur in ``grue a tour``.

Two rules fix that, and both have to hold on the database side. Matching a
single term is useless if the row was already filtered out.

Word order and adjacency
    The query is split into terms and every term has to appear somewhere in
    the row, in any order and with anything in between. A row containing the
    whole query as a phrase satisfies that too, so this only ever widens what
    the picker finds.

Accents
    Catalogue text carries them, laptop typists skip them. Both sides are
    folded to their unaccented base, so ``acces`` finds ``accès`` and the
    other way round. The fold is applied in SQL with ``translate()`` rather
    than by an extension so nothing has to be installed into the database.

Only foldings that keep the character count are applied, which is the same
rule the picker's client-side highlighter uses. That is deliberate: the two
have to agree, or the server would return a row the client then declines to
mark, which reads as a bug in the marking. It is also forced by
``translate()``, whose mapping is character to character, so a fold such as
``ß`` to ``ss`` cannot be expressed. Those characters are left alone on both
sides and match themselves.
