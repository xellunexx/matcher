"""Tenant-scope resolution (multi-tenant isolation, Phase 1 scaffolding).

This module centralizes "which tenant is the caller?" into one place so
that, as data-access layers are hardened module-by-module, they can all
ask the same question the same way instead of each re-deriving the owner
id from the JWT.

Current state (single-tenant installs - the only shape shipped today)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
There is **no separate Tenant/Org entity** and **no ``tenant_id`` claim
in the JWT**. The "tenant" is simply the owning user's id (the JWT
``sub``). This matches the existing on-disk convention:

* ``Contact.tenant_id`` is backfilled to ``created_by`` (the creator's
  user id) by migration ``v231_contact_tenant_id`` - see its docstring:
  *"For single-tenant installs ... it equals the creator's user id."*
* ``dashboards.Snapshot.tenant_id`` is written as ``str(user_id)``.

So resolving the tenant to ``payload["sub"]`` produces exactly the value
those columns already store, which is why wiring a future query through
:data:`CurrentTenantId` is behaviour-preserving rather than a new policy.

Forward compatibility
----------------------
:func:`resolve_tenant_id` prefers an explicit ``tenant_id`` claim when
one is present, falling back to ``sub`` only when it is absent. The day a
real Tenants table + a ``tenant_id`` claim land in
:func:`app.modules.users.service.create_access_token`, this resolver
starts returning the org id with **no call-site changes**.

NON-BREAKING GUARANTEE
----------------------
The FastAPI dependency :data:`CurrentTenantId` is wired in
:mod:`app.dependencies` on top of ``get_optional_user_payload``, which
returns ``None`` for anonymous / unknown callers instead of raising. The
dependency therefore:

* never adds a 401/403 to an endpoint that did not already have one, and
* returns ``None`` whenever the tenant cannot be determined.

A ``None`` tenant must be treated by callers as "do not narrow the query"
**only** where that is already the established admin/unrestricted policy;
on a tenant-gated endpoint a ``None`` should scope to nothing (the safe
default, mirroring :func:`app.dependencies.accessible_project_ids`). No
endpoint is changed by merely importing this module - it is plumbing plus
one or two reference usages until Phase 2 rolls it out per module.

This is the app-layer half of the multi-tenant plan. PostgreSQL-native
RLS is a later, optional phase and is a deliberate no-op today (the
embedded cluster connects as the ``postgres`` superuser, which bypasses
RLS unless every table also sets ``FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY``).

Import safety
-------------
This module intentionally imports **nothing** from :mod:`app.dependencies`
or :mod:`app.database` at module load. The pure resolver
:func:`resolve_tenant_id` is therefore importable (and unit-testable) in
any environment, even where the embedded PostgreSQL engine is not yet up.
The request-time dependency is assembled in :mod:`app.dependencies`
(which already owns the DB-session plumbing), keeping the import edge
one-directional: ``dependencies -> tenant_scope`` only, never back.

    Centralises the ``owner_filter = None if admin else user_id`` idiom
    currently copy-pasted across routers (e.g. ``contacts.list_contacts``).
    Pass the result as the ``owner_id=`` argument of a repository method

    admin both map to ``None`` here. That is correct for the
    *company-wide* resources this helper targets (contacts, subcontractors,
    supplier catalogs), where the repository's ``owner_id=None`` branch is
    the admin/unrestricted view and an anonymous caller never reaches the
    handler (a ``RequirePermission`` guard rejects them first). Do **not**
