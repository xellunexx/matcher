"""Celery application factory - RFC 34 §4 W0.1.

The Celery app is the thin transport layer that hands JobRun ids to
worker processes. It is intentionally framework-agnostic: business
handlers are registered via :mod:`app.core.job_runner`, never via raw
``@celery_app.task`` decorators. This keeps the worker entry point a
single, well-tested generic dispatcher (``oe.dispatch_job``) and lets
modules add new background work without touching this file.

Configuration is locked to JSON serialization (so payloads remain
inspectable in Redis), UTC timestamps (so log correlation is sane
across regions), and a 10-minute hard timeout (so a misbehaving task
cannot pin a worker forever).

Environment overrides:
    OE_CELERY_BROKER_URL   - default ``redis://localhost:6379/1``
    OE_CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND - default ``redis://localhost:6379/1``
