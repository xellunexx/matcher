"""Shared, battle-tested safe zip extraction.

This is the single implementation of zip-member safety used by:
  * ``app.cli.cmd_module_install`` (installing a business module .zip)
  * ``app.core.partner_pack.discovery`` (auto-extracting a dropped pack .zip)
  * ``app.core.partner_pack.router`` (the ``POST /install`` upload endpoint)

It guards against the classic untrusted-archive attacks (Zip Slip and
friends): absolute paths, ``..`` traversal, Windows drive letters, backslash
separators and symlink members. Every member is validated **twice** - once up
front before any filesystem write, and again at write time against the resolved
staging root (defence in depth against a crafted ``ZipInfo`` whose name passes
the string checks but resolves outside the target).

Extraction is staged: files are written into a temporary directory and only the
finished package directory is atomically moved into place, so a mid-extract
failure never leaves a half-written tree in a scanned location.
