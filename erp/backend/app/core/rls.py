"""Row-level-security tenant plumbing (default OFF).

PostgreSQL row-level security is the backstop under the app-layer tenant
guards: even if a query forgets its ``tenant_id`` filter, the database refuses
to return or change another tenant's rows. It is enforced only when
``settings.rls_enforce`` is True, because the app otherwise connects as the
cluster superuser, and a superuser bypasses every policy. The flag is opt-in,
so this module is inert on a default install.

Mechanism, when enabled (single connection, no second engine):

* A per-request :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` carries the caller's tenant.
  ``rls_request_context`` (in ``app.dependencies``) binds it at the top of a
  request and clears it at the end. The default is a private ``_UNSET`` sentinel
  so a background/out-of-request session (which never binds it) is
  distinguishable from an anonymous request (which binds ``None``).
* An ``after_begin`` listener runs on every transaction of the request session:
    - background session (``_UNSET``): do nothing, so the transaction keeps the
      connecting superuser role and bypasses RLS, exactly as before;
    - request session: ``SET LOCAL ROLE`` to the non-superuser runtime role so
      policies apply, then stamp a transaction-local ``app.current_tenant`` GUC.
      ``SET LOCAL`` is transaction-scoped, so it resets on commit and never
      contaminates the pooled connection; the listener re-applies it on the next
      transaction, so it survives mid-request commits.
* An anonymous request binds ``None`` -> empty GUC -> a fail-closed policy
  (``tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant', true)``) matches no
  tenant rows, while global reference tables (never policied) stay readable.

Import-light (SQLAlchemy + settings only) so the database layer can import it
without a dependency cycle.
