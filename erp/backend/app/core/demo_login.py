"""Persisted "is the public demo login enabled" switch (admin-controlled).

This is deliberately separate from :mod:`app.core.demo_seed`, which decides
whether the startup seeder installs the demo accounts and showcase projects.
That decision is about what gets created on boot; this flag is about whether the
password-free "Try demo" sign-in is *offered* right now. Keeping them apart lets
a site admin turn the demo login off from the Settings screen at runtime,
without a restart and without wiping the seeded demo data (which they can still
remove separately).

Persistence is a small JSON file in the data dir, exactly like
:mod:`app.core.app_branding`, so it needs no database table and no migration::

    <data-dir>/demo_login_enabled.json   ->   {"enabled": false}

The default, when no file has been written, is ``True`` - the historical
behaviour where a seeded demo account can be used to sign in. The *effective*
availability of the demo login is::

    seed_demo_enabled() AND demo_login_enabled()

i.e. there must be a demo account to sign into AND the admin must not have
switched it off. Operators who want to force the demo login off regardless of
the admin toggle can still set ``SEED_DEMO=false``, which disables it through the
seed gate.

stdlib-only so it stays cheap to import (the auth path calls it on every demo
sign-in) and reuses the same data-dir resolution as the other core singletons.
