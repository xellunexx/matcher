# Flagship demo: Secondary school with seismic base isolation, Christchurch (NZ)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Post-earthquake rebuild of a state secondary school in Christchurch. Designed
# and procured the way a New Zealand quantity surveyor would price it: an
# elemental cost plan to NRM 1 conventions (NZIQS practice), measured trades,
# building consent under the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC). Structure designed
# to NZS 3404 (steel), NZS 3101 (concrete) and the timber standards NZS 3603 /
# NZS 3604, with engineered timber (LVL portals and CLT floors / shear walls)
# to AS/NZS 1328. Loads and earthquake actions to NZS 1170 / NZS 1170.5.
#
# Because schools are critical post-disaster facilities, the buildings are
# designed to Importance Level 3 (assembly / many occupants) with the gym and
# hall acting as a community Civil Defence shelter (Importance Level 4 detailing
# on the egress and services routes). The whole site sits on lead-rubber
# bearings and flat sliders, so the superstructure is base isolated above a
# stiff foundation diaphragm - the post-2011 Canterbury rebuild approach.
#
# Procurement follows the Ministry of Education property design standards
# (DQLS designation, Te Rautaki Rawa Kura / Designing Schools in New Zealand,
# the Acoustic and IAQ guidelines) and an ECI / NZS 3910:2023 head contract.
# All rates are NZD, GST exclusive, at Christchurch Q1 2026 price level. GST
# (15%) is carried as a separate cumulative markup, never baked into the rates.
#
# Program: a 1,100-roll co-educational secondary school (Years 9-13) of approx.
# 11,800 m2 GFA across four linked, base-isolated blocks - two two-storey
# Innovative Learning Environment teaching blocks, a specialist science / arts
# / technology block, a double-court gymnasium, and a 600-seat assembly hall /
# performing-arts space - plus hard courts, fields and external works on a
# 4.2 ha greenfield platform. Importance Level 3, Canterbury seismic hazard
# (Z=0.30, soil Class D / deep alluvium), wind region A6. Headline construction
# cost circa NZD 66 million (GST exclusive).
