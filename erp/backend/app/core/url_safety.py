"""SSRF-safe URL validation.

Used by webhook and outbound-webhook-like features to reject URLs that would
point a server-side HTTP client at the loopback interface, RFC1918 / carrier-
grade NAT / link-local ranges, cloud-metadata addresses, multicast, or any
non-http(s) scheme (``file://``, ``gopher://``, ``dict://`` …).

Two layers of protection:
    1. ``validate_external_url`` - synchronous, no DNS, good for Pydantic
       validators. Rejects bad schemes, literal IPs in blocklisted ranges,
       and the small set of hard-coded cloud metadata hostnames.
    2. ``resolve_and_validate_external_url`` - async, performs DNS lookup
       and rejects any resolved address in a blocklisted range. Call this
       right before ``httpx.post`` so a DNS rebinding or a hostname that
       resolves to a private IP is caught at dispatch time.

Both helpers raise ``UnsafeUrlError`` (a subclass of ``ValueError``) so they
can be used inside Pydantic field validators without any adapter layer.

# ── Self-hosted AI provider endpoints (Ollama / vLLM) ────────────────────────

# The AI-settings page lets a user point the platform at a self-hosted, OpenAI-
# compatible runtime (Ollama, vLLM) by URL, which is then fetched server-side -
# an SSRF vector. Unlike a webhook it LEGITIMATELY needs to reach loopback
# (Ollama on localhost) and RFC1918 (vLLM on a Docker / LAN host), so the
# webhook policy above (which blocks all loopback / private) is too strict here.
#
# The AI policy therefore permits loopback and private ranges by default while
# ALWAYS blocking the ranges an inference endpoint has no business reaching:
# link-local (which covers the 169.254.169.254 cloud-metadata address),
# multicast, reserved, unspecified, and the known IPv6 cloud-metadata address.
# Operators who want a tighter posture configure an allowlist (hostnames and/or
# CIDR ranges); when set, only hosts in it are accepted.

# Cloud-metadata hostnames that are never a valid AI endpoint. Unlike the
# webhook block-list this deliberately does NOT include ``localhost`` - a local
# Ollama is a first-class, supported setup.
