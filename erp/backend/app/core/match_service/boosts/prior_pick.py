"""Prior-pick boost - reward codes the team already confirmed for this work.

This closes the match learning loop. When an estimator confirms a
catalogue code for a group (saving a :class:`MatchTemplate` to the
library, or simply picking a suggestion the search logged), that choice
becomes durable signal: the next time a group with the same normalized
signature is matched, the code the team trusted before should surface at
the top instead of being re-litigated by cosine similarity alone.

The boost itself is intentionally dumb and DB-free so it stays a pure,
fast, well-tested function on the ranker's hot path. All the reading of
the persisted signals (``MatchTemplate`` + ``MatchSearchLog`` picks) and
the resolution to a live catalogue row happens in the match-elements
service, which owns those tables and holds the group signature. The
service packages the result into a :class:`PriorPickContext` and binds it
for the duration of one ranker call via :func:`bind` / :func:`applied`.

Two strengths of signal are carried:

* **template** - an explicit "save this mapping" confirmation. Strong.
  Matched by the candidate's ``id`` (real ``CostItem.id``) or ``code``.
* **history** - the code the team keeps picking from the suggestions for
  this signature (``MatchSearchLog.picked_rate_code``). Weaker, matched
  by ``code``.

The ranker registers :func:`boost` in its narrow boost stack, so a prior
code gets its score lifted *before* the confidence band is derived - a
previously-confirmed rate reads as high confidence, not a mid-list guess.
