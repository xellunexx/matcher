"""Local BGE cross-encoder rerank tier - free, fast, gracefully degrades.

The bi-encoder + RRF fusion path in :mod:`qdrant_adapter` is fast but
noisy at the boundary between rank 1 and rank 5: the top candidates
have very similar fused scores so small lexical differences (concrete
grade ``C30/37`` vs ``C25/30``) get smoothed out. A cross-encoder
re-scores ``(query, candidate)`` pairs *together* through one transformer
forward pass - substantially better at fine discrimination.

Where this differs from :mod:`reranker_ai`:

* No API cost - runs locally on CPU (or GPU when present).
* No latency budget tradeoff - INT8 ONNX BGE-reranker-v2-m3 reranks
  10 pairs in ~200 ms on a typical VPS, well under the user-facing
  budget.
* No external dependency at import time - :func:`rerank` lazy-imports
  ``FlagEmbedding.FlagReranker`` and falls through cleanly when the
  ``[semantic]`` extra is missing.

The bge variant is **not** opt-in like the LLM reranker - it runs on
every match request once enabled in settings. The opt-out is via
``settings.match_use_bge_reranker = False`` for installs where the
extra disk footprint (~568 MB FP32, ~140 MB INT8) is too much.

Model selection follows :data:`RERANK_BGE_MODEL_NAME` from
:mod:`config`. Default is ``BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`` - multilingual
across 100+ languages, MIT-licensed, same author as ``bge-m3`` so
cross-encoder ↔ bi-encoder are trained on the same corpus.
