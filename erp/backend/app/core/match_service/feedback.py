"""Match feedback loop - captures user confirmations for offline tuning.

Every time the user accepts, rejects, or hand-overrides a match
suggestion the router calls :func:`record_feedback`. The captured
``AuditEntry`` carries the full envelope, the top candidates we
showed, and what the user actually picked - enough signal to retrain
boost weights and augment the golden set.

Capture is not the whole story: an acceptance is also the signal the
matcher's prior-pick logic learns from. So alongside the audit row we
best-effort stamp the accepted code onto the matching search-log row
(``MatchSearchLog.picked_rate_code`` / ``picked_rank``), which is the
read model the ranker's prior-pick boost and the exact-repeat
short-circuit consult next time the same line comes round.
