"""Tamper-evident export headers for register / report downloads.

Why this exists
===============
Across the platform a user can export a register "for the record" - a report,
a correspondence log, a signed-document manifest, an approval timeline. When
such a file is later attached to a claim, a submission or a dispute, two
questions always come up: *when* was it produced, and *is this the exact data
that was in the system at that moment*. A bare "Generated: <date>" line answers
the first but not the second - the file could have been edited after download.

This module gives every exporter one small, jurisdiction-neutral helper that
stamps a header with the generation time **and** a SHA-256 digest of the
content itself. Re-exporting the same underlying data yields the same digest,
so a recipient can recompute it and confirm the file was not altered. It makes
no legal claim - it is a tamper-evident audit trail, not a "court-grade"
signature (that is what the signing workflow is for).

Design
======
- **Pure and deterministic.** No DB, no network, no clock. The caller passes
  the already-resolved ``generated_at`` string; the digest is computed over a
  canonical JSON serialisation of the content payload with sorted keys, so the
  same data always hashes to the same value regardless of dict ordering,
  platform or export format.
- **Timestamp is excluded from the digest.** The digest identifies the
  *dataset*, not the moment of export, so two exports of unchanged data match.
- **Format-agnostic.** Returns plain ``(label, value)`` pairs; each exporter
  (CSV / XLSX / PDF, or any future register export) renders them in its own
  header style. Labels resolve through the shared ``translate()`` so the header
  can be localised without touching call sites.
