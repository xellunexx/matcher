"""Whether this install may ask the internet for a newer version.

The product carries two update checks. The desktop launcher asks GitHub for
itself (``desktop/src-tauri/src/update_check.rs``), and the signed-in web UI
asks the backend, which then asks PyPI and GitHub
(``GET /api/system/version-check`` in ``app/main.py``). Both are outbound
requests the user did not start, so both have to stop when the user or an
administrator says so.

Until this module existed only the launcher listened. The notice the launcher
paints offers "Turn off update checks" and records the answer in
``~/.openestimate/no-update-check``, a file whose own text says the app "does
not check for a newer version while this file exists". The backend never read
it, so the next sign-in sent the same two requests anyway. An administrator
setting ``OE_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`` was ignored by the backend the same way.

This reads both switches with the launcher's exact spelling, so turning the
check off in either place turns it off in both.
