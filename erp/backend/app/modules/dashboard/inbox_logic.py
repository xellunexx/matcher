"""Pure (DB-free) helpers for the unified approvals/alerts inbox.

This module deliberately imports **nothing** from SQLAlchemy or
``app.database`` so the normalise / merge / sort / scope logic can be unit
tested on any Python without a database (mirrors the dashboard module's
"don't break the page" posture and the project's no-DB-import unit-test
rule).

The DB query layer (``inbox.py``) fetches rows from the existing per-module
stores - file-approval steps, change-order approval steps, and the caller's
unread notifications - normalises each into the small ``dict`` shape the
functions here expect, then calls :func:`build_inbox` to produce the final,
deterministically-sorted, project-scoped payload the router returns.

Item shape (one entry in the merged list)::

    {
        "id": str,            # stable per-source id (prefixed by kind)
        "kind": "approval" | "alert",
        "source": str,        # module of origin, e.g. "file_approval"
        "title": str,         # already-resolved English text OR i18n key

    accessible_project_ids:
        Project ids the caller may see, or ``None`` for admin/unscoped.
        Used as a defence-in-depth second filter even though the DB layer
        already scopes its queries - so a future caller can't accidentally

    item_states:
        What the caller already did with individual rows (item id -> state).
        Dismissed rows are removed before anything is counted, so the counts
        agree with the list rather than promising work that is no longer
