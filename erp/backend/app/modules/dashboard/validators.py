"""Validation rules for inbox actions.

The inbox is the one screen where a person clears work off their plate, so the
write path it just gained is the write path most worth guarding. Three rules in
the ``inbox_action`` rule set:

* ``inbox_action.item_id_recognised`` - ERROR. The id must name a source this
  module produces and carry a UUID. The id is not a foreign key - the row it
  refers to lives in whichever module produced it - so nothing else in the
  stack would catch a typo, and the state row would simply sit there being read
  by nobody.
* ``inbox_action.state_known``        - ERROR. The state must be
  ``acknowledged`` or ``dismissed``. A third value would be stored happily and
  then ignored by the filter, which reads as "the dismiss button did nothing".
* ``inbox_action.dismissal_decides_nothing`` - INFO, and the reason this rule
  set exists rather than a pair of ``if`` statements. Dismissing an approval
  takes it off one person's triage list; the step stays ``pending`` and stays
  visible in the module that owns it. The finding is persisted on the state row
  so an audit of who cleared what can tell a hidden approval from a decided
  one, which is exactly the distinction a dispute turns on.

Every rule reads the plain dict the service hands it, so none of them needs a
database session and all of them are unit-testable in isolation.
