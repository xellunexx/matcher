"""Unified approvals/alerts inbox aggregator.

Surfaces, in ONE place, the two things a user opens the app to act on:

* **Pending approvals** assigned to them - file-approval steps and
  change-order approval steps where they are the named approver and the
  step is still ``pending``.
* **Alerts** - their own unread in-app notifications.

Both streams are scoped to the caller's accessible projects (the same IDOR
posture as the rest of the dashboard module: rows the caller can't see are
silently dropped, never 403). Neither stream is owned here - both are read from
the existing per-module tables and merged. The one thing this module does own
is ``oe_dashboard_inbox_item_state``: what the caller already did with a row
(see :mod:`inbox_actions`), which is applied on the way out so a dismissed row
stops coming back. The pure merge / sort / scope / state logic lives in
:mod:`inbox_logic` (DB-free, unit-tested); this file is only the query +
normalise layer.

Sibling-module models are imported **inside** the function so a slim install
that disabled (e.g.) ``oe_file_approvals`` or ``oe_changeorders`` still loads
this module - a failed import for one source degrades that source to empty,
exactly like ``compute_rollup``.
