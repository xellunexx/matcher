"""Data access for per-user inbox item states.

Every read takes the owner's id as a required argument rather than inferring
it. A state row is private by construction: it says what one person did with
one row of their own list, and there is no query here that can return anybody
else's.

Reads use ``select()`` with an explicit owner predicate rather than
``session.get()``, which answers from the identity map and cannot express the
owner filter at all.
