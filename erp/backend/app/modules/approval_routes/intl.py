"""International, framework-free approval-routing helpers.

Small, side-effect-free helpers that make multi-step approval reporting correct
and clear for users anywhere in the world. There is no database, no FastAPI and
no third-party dependency here, so this module imports and runs the same in a
unit test as it does in the request path. It sits beside the other pure engines
in this module (:mod:`sla_engine`, :mod:`escalation`, :mod:`delegation_engine`)
and follows the same rules.

Design rules that keep the platform usable worldwide:

* No hardcoded locale. Decision and status words are localised (English,
  German, Russian) with an English fallback, so an operator reads plain
  language, never a raw code, whatever their language.
* Dates are ISO 8601 (``YYYY-MM-DD``). A "days" threshold such as an SLA grace
  period is always an explicit parameter, never a buried constant, so a team in
  any jurisdiction sets its own service level.
* Every rate stays in a defined range. A completion rate is a ``Decimal`` in
  ``[0, 1]`` (and ``[0, 100]`` as a percentage), guarded against division by
  zero, so it can never become a ``NaN`` or an infinity.
* Bad input (negative counts, more completed steps than exist, a garbage date)
  is turned into a clear ``ValueError`` or a well-defined value. It never
  becomes a 500, a ``NaN``, or an infinity.
* Every figure is explainable: a plain-language glossary states in one line
  what an approval step, a completion rate, or an overdue step means, and the
  breakdown helpers expose the components a rate was derived from.

The service layer keeps its own ``HTTPException``-raising helpers. These
functions raise plain ``ValueError`` so they stay reusable outside a request
(reports, exports, background jobs, tests). A caller at the API edge can wrap a
``ValueError`` in a 400.
