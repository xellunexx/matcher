"""Pure multi-source change-request intake normalizer.

Change requests arrive in many foreign shapes - a row pulled from a tracker
spreadsheet ("Change No", "Estimated $", "Time (days)"), an email intake form
("Subject", "Cost Impact", "Raised By"), a partner portal export. Each names the
same handful of facts differently, prices money as a formatted string with a
currency symbol, and states a schedule slip in whatever unit the author felt
like typing. This engine takes one such foreign record plus a mapping profile
that describes its dialect and turns it into a canonical
:class:`NormalizedChangeDraft` the change / variation modules can act on.

The normalisation is deterministic and forgiving. Field names are matched
case-insensitively and whitespace-tolerantly against the profile's alias table;
money strings are parsed to :class:`decimal.Decimal` with thousands separators
and currency symbols / codes stripped (and the currency recorded when one is
detected); schedule values are coerced through a unit-synonym table to a plain
day count; categorical values are run through a value-synonym table. Nothing in
a foreign record is ever dropped silently: a field with no alias is recorded in
``unmapped_fields``, a required canonical field left empty lands in
``missing_required``, and anything that could not be parsed adds a warning
rather than raising. ``completeness`` is the fraction of the profile's required
fields that ended up present and parseable, mirroring the completeness signal the
:mod:`~app.modules.change_intelligence.clarifier` exposes.

No database, no ORM, no ``app.*`` imports - standard library only (Decimal for
money) - so it unit-tests on the local Python 3.11 runner like the other pure
engines. A thin service layer (written separately) loads the stored mapping
profile, feeds the foreign record in, and either previews or persists the draft.

Scope note: money / currency detection is lexical, not semantic. It reads the
symbols and codes present in the text, so a field that mixes two currency codes
records the first one detected and warns; it does not attempt FX or validate
that the recorded currency is the project currency. Confirming the real figures
stays with the author and the commercial review, exactly as in the clarifier.
