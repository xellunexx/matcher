"""Pure decision-time impact preview for a candidate change.

At the approval decision point a reviewer needs one number that the change
board does not give them: not "what will this change cost", but "what does
approving this change ADD on top of everything already committed". This engine
answers exactly that. It takes the set of changes that are already committed
(those whose status is committed for their own kind, see
:data:`COMMITTED_STATUSES_BY_KIND`) plus the one candidate
change being decided, and produces a before / after position per change-kind
and per currency: the currently committed cost and days, the candidate's signed
delta, and the resulting position if the candidate is approved.

Money discipline matches the rest of the change-intelligence and cost-recovery
engines. Every cost figure is a signed :class:`~decimal.Decimal` quantized to
two places with half-up rounding, and amounts in different currency codes are
NEVER summed together: a candidate priced in EUR against committed work in USD
yields two separate rows and two separate currency totals. Schedule impacts are
signed whole-or-fractional day counts summed as :class:`~decimal.Decimal`
(acceleration may be negative) and are likewise currency-scoped so the
before / after table reads as one coherent row per (kind, currency).

The committed-status vocabularies mirror the change-intelligence service layer
(``_CO_APPROVED_STATUSES`` and ``_VO_AGREED_STATUSES``): a change order counts as
committed once it is ``approved`` or ``executed``, a variation order once it is
issued or beyond. Both are duplicated here as :data:`COMMITTED_STATUSES_BY_KIND`
so this stays a self-contained pure module: no database, no ORM, no ``app.*``
imports, stdlib plus ``Decimal`` only, and it unit-tests on the local Python
3.11 runner exactly like the sibling engines.
A thin service layer gathers the committed change rows and the candidate and
feeds them in; this engine reads no clock and no I/O, so identical inputs always
produce an identical result.

Only committed items count toward the "current committed" baseline. A candidate
is the prospective change under decision and is always treated as a delta on top
of that baseline regardless of its own status - so a reviewer sees the same
preview whether the candidate is still a draft, pending, or has just been
provisionally marked. Statuses are compared case-insensitively after trimming
surrounding whitespace, matching how the service layer normalises them.

# The families do NOT share a status vocabulary and a single set cannot serve

# order's FSM is ``issued -> in_progress -> completed | voided`` and never
# passes through either of those words. One shared set therefore matched no
# variation order at all, and the baseline silently understated committed cost
# and days by the whole value of every agreed VO.

# Mirrors ``service._CO_APPROVED_STATUSES`` and ``service._VO_AGREED_STATUSES``.

# pins the two copies together. Compared case-insensitively after trimming, so
