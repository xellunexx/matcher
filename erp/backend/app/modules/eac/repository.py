"""Data access for EAC block graphs.

Every function is tenant-scoped: the tenant id is a required argument, never
inferred, so a caller cannot accidentally reach across tenants by forgetting a
filter. Reads return ``None`` rather than raising, leaving the 404 decision to
the router.

Two things worth knowing about how this layer behaves:

* Reads use ``select()`` with an explicit tenant predicate rather than
  ``session.get()``. ``session.get()`` answers from the identity map, so it can
  hand back a row another statement in the same session already deleted, and it
  cannot express the tenant filter at all.
* Writing a canvas replaces the whole graph body. The blocks and wires are
  deleted and re-inserted rather than diffed, which matches what the editor
  sends (``loadGraph`` takes a whole snapshot) and keeps ordinals contiguous
  without a reorder dance. Block identity survives because it lives in
  ``client_id``, not in the database primary key.

    Ordinals are assigned 0..n-1 in the order received, so the "ordered set" is
    exactly the order the estimator's canvas produced. No fractional order key
    is used: whole-snapshot writes make explicit renumbering free, and a derived
    key eventually exhausts its precision under repeated insertion at one point.

    The existing rows go in one bulk DELETE each rather than through the
    relationship collection, so a graph with a few hundred blocks costs two
    statements instead of a per-row cascade.

    Two details make that safe in an async session, and both are easy to get
    wrong:

    * The deletes carry ``synchronize_session="fetch"`` so the ORM marks the
      matching in-memory children deleted. Without it they stay persistent
      ghosts in the identity map, still holding the ``(graph_id, client_id)``
      pair the new rows are about to reuse.
    * The collections are re-read with an awaited ``session.refresh`` rather
      than assigned. Assigning to a loaded collection makes SQLAlchemy load the
      current contents first to work out the orphans, and that load is emitted
      outside the greenlet, which is exactly the ``MissingGreenlet`` this
      codebase keeps meeting.
