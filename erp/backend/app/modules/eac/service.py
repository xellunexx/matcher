"""High-level service layer for EAC v2 (RFC 35 §1.7, task #221).

This is the seam between the HTTP router and the engine internals.
Routers get the auth/tenant guard, the service composes the engine
calls and publishes events on state-changing operations so other
modules (audit, notifications, scheduling) can react without coupling.

All public methods are ``async def``. Read-only methods do not publish
events; state-changing methods (``cancel``, ``rerun``) do.
