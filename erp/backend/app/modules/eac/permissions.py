    "authenticated + same tenant". Reads stay at VIEWER; authoring and
    running rules/rulesets requires at least EDITOR; destructive deletes
    require MANAGER. ``eac.run`` also covers dry-run / validate / compile
    because those feed user-supplied rule definitions/formulas into the
    executor and must not be reachable by a read-only viewer.
