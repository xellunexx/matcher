"""Validation rules for the EAC visual block graph.

A block graph is the estimator's own drawing of a rule: blocks at canvas
coordinates, wired together through typed slots. It is saved constantly and
half-finished most of the time, so these rules never block a save. They run on
every write and their findings are persisted on the row, which is what turns
"is this methodology actually sound?" from a question the estimator has to hold
in their head into a traffic light they can see in a list.

Four rules, all in the ``eac_graph`` rule set:

* ``eac_graph.block_reference_exists`` - ERROR. A wire must land on a block that
  is on the canvas, and on a slot that exists on *that* block. This is the rule a
  foreign key cannot express, and the reason connections are stored by client id
  rather than by FK.
* ``eac_graph.no_cycles``              - ERROR. The wiring must be acyclic. A
  cyclic graph cannot be evaluated: every block waits on itself. A self-wired
  block is the degenerate case and is caught here too, matching the canvas store,
  which refuses to draw one.
* ``eac_graph.slot_type_compatible``   - ERROR. A wire runs output to input, and
  the two data types must be compatible. Mirrors ``canConnectSlots`` in
  ``features/eac/canvas/dnd.ts``, so the server cannot accept a graph the editor
  would have refused to draw, nor refuse one it drew.
* ``eac_graph.parameter_domain``       - ERROR. A block parameter must sit inside
  the domain the block kind declares: a constraint operator must be one of the 25
  the spec defines, a range operator needs exactly two bounds, and an operator
  that takes no operand must not carry one.

Every rule reads the same plain-dict shape the service hands it, so none of them
needs a database session and all of them are unit-testable in isolation.
