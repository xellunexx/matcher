"""Project Controls module manifest.

A thin, read-only consumer module (connective-tissue feature 09). It joins
the cost spine, schedule, quality, safety, risk and change data into one
executive controls snapshot via the shared ``bi_dashboards.kpis`` registry.

It owns NO tables and writes to no other module. The snapshot endpoint is a
single-round-trip aggregation over KPIs other modules already compute, with
status banding and cross-module drill-down deep links.
