"""Direct upload routes.

Endpoints:
    PUT  /local/{token}    - Consume an HMAC-signed token minted by
                              :meth:`LocalStorageBackend.presigned_put_url`
                              and stream the request body into the storage
                              backend (single PUT or multipart part).

The token payload is produced by
:func:`app.core.storage._sign_local_upload_token` and verified here via
:func:`app.core.storage._verify_local_upload_token`. Both helpers live in
``app.core.storage`` so this router treats them as opaque and only relies
on the documented payload shape.

Token payload shape::

    {
        "key": "<storage key>",
        "expires_at": <unix-ts>,
        "content_type": "<mime>" | "",
        # Multipart-only (W0.5):
        "upload_id": "<hex>"     ,  # optional
        "part_number": <int>     ,  # optional, 1-based
    }

When ``upload_id`` and ``part_number`` are both present the request body
is uploaded as a single multipart part. Otherwise the body is written to
``key`` via :meth:`LocalStorageBackend.put`.

This route is only valid against the local backend. When
``STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`` the S3 backend itself mints true presigned URLs
that bypass this app - calling here returns HTTP 400 to prevent
silent misroutes during operator misconfiguration.
