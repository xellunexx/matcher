        "Generic engine for the structured XML documents a delivery must hand "

        "field set, schema version) so a new format is a new profile, not new "

        "GAEB-X83-shaped tender example, a COBie-shaped handover example); "
        "regional packs plug in national dialects such as RU Minstroy. The same "
        "payload is the single source for both the machine XML and the human "
        "review, and a submission must validate cleanly before it can be sent."
