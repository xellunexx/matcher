"""Validation rule for the authority-submission factory.

``submission_schema_valid`` is the gate that a submission must pass before it can
be marked submitted: the payload has to satisfy its profile's ``field_spec`` (no
missing required fields, no type mismatches). It reuses the pure
:func:`app.modules.authority_submission.service.validate_payload` engine so the
rule and the ``/validate`` endpoint can never disagree.
