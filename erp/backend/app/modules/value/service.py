"""Value-realized service - the thin database layer over the pure value engines.

This module owns no records of its own. It gathers figures that other services
have ALREADY computed and feeds them to the pure :mod:`app.modules.value`
engines, composing a single "value realized" view a dashboard can show without
re-deriving anything:

* approved-change committed cost + schedule  -> ``change_intelligence`` impact
  gathering (:func:`gather_approved_changes`), mapped onto
  :class:`value_math.ImpactInput`.
* recovery ledger (chargeable / recovered / absorbed per currency)  -> the
  ``cost_recovery`` back-charge engine via
  :func:`compute_recovery_performance`, mapped onto
  :class:`value_math.RecoveryInput`.
* admin hours given back  -> ``oe_activity_log`` rows scoped to the project the
  same way the timeline does (``parent_entity_id`` / ``entity_id`` == project),
  mapped onto :class:`time_saved.ActivityEvent` and summed with the documented
  default minute factors.
* cohort adoption benchmark  -> per project a :class:`adoption_benchmark.ProjectAdoption`
  assembled from activity volume, change volume, the traceable-change share
  (a change with a recorded ball-in-court owner), the recovery rate and the
  average open-change cycle days.

Every read is scoped exactly like the other project-scoped services; the
request-scoped session dependency owns the commit, and this layer only ever
queries, so it never writes.

Honest gaps (passed as ``None``; the engines handle ``None`` with low-n
confidence): a single project's cost-position percentile vs its own portfolio is
not cheaply available without recomputing every project's BOQ rollup, so the
per-project benchmark percentile is ``None`` here; ``overrun_pct`` for the
adoption benchmark needs a budget baseline this layer does not have, so it is
also ``None``.
