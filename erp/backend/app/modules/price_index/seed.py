"""Deterministic demo seed for the Price Index module.

Loads one generic construction cost index series with a handful of periods and
a few regional factors so the page is never empty on a fresh install. The seed
is idempotent: it keys on the series name and on each region code, so re-running
it never duplicates a row. Only generic vocabulary is used - no named published
index.

Usage:
    >>> from app.modules.price_index.seed import seed_price_index_demo
    >>> await seed_price_index_demo(session)
