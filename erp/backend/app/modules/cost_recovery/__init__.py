"""Cost recovery / back-charge module.

Records costs the project intends to recover from the party held responsible for
causing them - rework arising from a subcontractor defect, extra cost from a
supplier delay - and rolls them up into a recovery ledger: how much is
chargeable, how much has been recovered, and what is still outstanding against
whom. The pure :mod:`back_charge` engine does the money math (stdlib only, so it
unit-tests on the local runner without the database or web framework); a thin
service persists the records and feeds them in.

The module loader discovers and mounts the ``router`` submodule at
``/api/v1/cost-recovery`` and calls :func:`on_startup` once at boot; this
``__init__`` does not import the router at top level so the engine stays
independently importable.
