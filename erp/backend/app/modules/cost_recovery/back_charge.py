"""Pure back-charge / cost-recovery math.

A back-charge is a cost the project intends to recover from the party held
responsible for causing it - for example rework arising from a subcontractor's
defect, or extra cost from a supplier's delay. Given the current state of every
back-charge record (a :class:`BackChargeItem`) this engine computes the
chargeable amount for each item, what remains outstanding, and rolls the items
up two ways: per responsible party (split by currency) and per currency. The
result is a :class:`RecoveryLedger` that tells the commercial team how much is
recoverable, how much has been recovered, and what is still outstanding against
whom.

No database, no ORM, no ``app.*`` imports - stdlib only - so it unit-tests on
the local Python 3.11 runner exactly like the other pure engines. A thin
service layer (written separately) gathers the records and feeds them in.

Money is always :class:`decimal.Decimal`, quantized to two places with
half-up rounding. Amounts denominated in different currency codes are never
summed together; every rollup that carries money is scoped to a single
currency, and a party holding back-charges in two currencies yields two party
rows.
