"""Timeline data access over the shared activity-log table.

The timeline owns no table of its own, so this repository is read-only: it
builds the selects against :class:`app.core.audit_log.ActivityLog` and hands
back ORM rows. Keeping them here rather than in the service means the ordering
contract lives in exactly one place, which is the whole point - see
:func:`_ordered`.
