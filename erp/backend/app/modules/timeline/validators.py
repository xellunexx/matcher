"""Timeline validation rules.

A timeline is only worth reading if the rows on it can be reached, linked and
attributed. These rules are the reader that objects when they cannot:

* ``timeline.unroutable_entry``    - ERROR. A row carrying neither a parent
                                     project nor an entity id. No timeline
                                     query can ever return it, so it is a write
                                     that reads as coverage.
* ``timeline.entry_without_entity`` - WARNING. A row that reaches a project feed
                                     but names no record, so a reader cannot
                                     open the thing it is about.
* ``timeline.unattributed_entry``  - WARNING. The event named an actor and the
                                     row lost them, so "who did this" is
                                     unanswerable for a row that could answer it.

The rules read plain :class:`app.core.audit_log.ActivityLog` rows so they can
run over any slice of the log - a project feed, one record's history, or a
backfill batch:

    {"entries": [ActivityLog, ...]}

They deliberately do not check *what* the timeline captures. That is a question
about the event allowlist versus the events ``app/`` publishes, which is
answered statically and gated in
``tests/modules/timeline/test_timeline_coverage.py``; a runtime rule could only
see the events that already arrived, which is the very set the allowlist
decides.

Registration follows the module convention: :func:`register_timeline_rules` is
idempotent and is called from the module's ``on_startup`` hook, and from the
test suite's fixture because no test process runs application startup.
