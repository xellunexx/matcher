"""Pure event-to-timeline mapping (no app.* imports, py3.11-testable).

The unified project timeline is built on top of the existing activity-log
store (``oe_activity_log``). A bridge subscriber listens to the in-memory
event bus and persists the *significant* cross-module domain events so the
timeline survives a restart (the event bus itself is in-memory only).

This module is deliberately dependency-free: it imports only the standard
library so it can be unit-tested under Python 3.11 without standing up the
application, a database, or the event bus. Every function is defensive and
never raises - a malformed event must never break the publisher.

Naming contract
---------------
Events follow dot-notation ``{module}.{entity}.{action}`` (see
``app.core.events``). Significance is decided by :data:`ALLOWLIST_PREFIXES`
(whole families) plus :data:`ALLOWLIST_EVENTS` (individual names inside a
family that is otherwise out of scope).

Both lists are derived from the event names ``app/`` actually publishes, and
``tests/modules/timeline/test_timeline_coverage.py`` holds them to that. The
earlier version of this module guessed at names - ``changeorder.`` where the
publisher says ``changeorders.``, ``schedule.`` where it says
``schedule_advanced.`` - and nine of its sixteen prefixes matched nothing at
all, so the timeline recorded 13 of 225 published events and looked healthy
while doing it.

Two rules govern what may be listed here, and the coverage test enforces both:

1. **It must be published.** An entry matching no name in ``app/`` is dead
   weight that reads like coverage.
2. **It must be routable.** Every publish site for the name must carry a
   project id (``project_id`` / ``projectId``). :func:`map_event` has no other
   way to reach a project, so an event without one produces a row that no
   project timeline can ever return - written, billed for, and invisible.

``correspondence.outbound.requested`` is the worked example of rule 2 and the
reason ``correspondence.`` is absent below: its publisher
(``app/modules/property_dev/service.py``) sends ``instalment_id`` and
``schedule_id`` but no project id, so every row it produced was unreachable.
Adding the project id at that publisher is the fix that would let the family
back in; that file is outside this module and was left alone.
