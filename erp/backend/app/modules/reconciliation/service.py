"""Event-reconciliation service - persistence + gather layer over the pure engine.

This module owns two responsibilities, both thin:

* **Gather**: read a project's heterogeneous source rows (correspondence, change
  orders, variations, management-of-change entries) and project each onto the
  pure engine's uniform :class:`CandidateRecord`. All scoring then happens in
  :mod:`app.modules.reconciliation.correlate` - the service never computes a
  confidence itself, it only adapts rows in.
* **Persist**: read and write :class:`RecordLink` rows, the durable record of a
  reviewer's confirm / reject decisions on the engine's suggestions.

Writes follow the platform convention: the service flushes, and the
request-scoped session dependency commits, so a failed request rolls back
cleanly. Every read is scoped to a single ``project_id`` so a row leaked under
the wrong project id is never returned (the engine itself also never links
across projects).
