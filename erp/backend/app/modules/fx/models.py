"""FX rate register ORM models: published rate sets, quotes, policy and PPP.

A construction project is routinely estimated in one currency, procured in a
second and reported to the client in a third, so "what is the rate" is never a
sufficient question. The register answers three:

* **Which rate applied on a date?** ``oe_fx_rate_set`` + ``oe_fx_rate_quote``
  hold the full history, one set per (base, date, source), so a figure priced
  last quarter can still be reproduced today.
* **Where did that rate come from?** A rate set carries its source, the
  document or URL it was read from, when it was fetched and whether it has been
  locked against further edits.
* **What did the project agree to use?** ``oe_fx_policy`` records the project's
  three currencies, whether it tracks live rates or a pinned set, and how stale
  a rate may get before it is flagged.

Tables:
    oe_fx_rate_set   - one published rate set: base currency, effective date,
        source and provenance. Owns its quotes.
    oe_fx_rate_quote - one currency's rate inside a set (units of the currency
        per one unit of the set's base currency).
    oe_fx_policy     - per-project currency policy and rate pinning.
    oe_fx_rate       - legacy "latest rate per pair" compatibility cache, kept
        current alongside the rate sets so an installation that has not
        refreshed since upgrading still resolves rates.
    oe_ppp_factor    - optional World Bank purchasing-power-parity factors.

Rates are ``Numeric(20, 10)`` on the new tables. Six decimals is enough for a
rate quoted against a strong currency but loses roughly one percent of an
inverse rate such as VND per EUR, and construction budgets are converted in
both directions.
