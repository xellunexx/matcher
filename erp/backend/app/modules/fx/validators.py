"""Validation rules for the FX register.

An exchange rate is the quietest way to get a cost report wrong. Nothing about
a project priced against a stale set, or against a set that does not quote the
currency the client is reported in, looks broken on screen - the numbers are
there, they are just not the numbers anyone agreed to. These rules are the
traffic light for that, and they run as part of the workflow rather than as a
button somebody remembers to press.

Five rules, all in the ``fx`` rule set:

* ``fx.quote_integrity``          - ERROR. Every quote must carry a real
  three-letter code that is not the set's own base, and a strictly positive
  rate. A zero rate divides by zero on the next conversion; a negative one
  flips the sign of a budget.
* ``fx.quote_movement``           - WARNING. A quote that jumped more than the
  tolerated percentage against the set it supersedes is flagged. A misplaced
  decimal in a feed or a hand-entered set reprices a whole estimate silently,
  and this is the only place it is visible before it does.
* ``fx.policy_currency_coverage`` - ERROR. The three currencies a project
  declares - estimating, procurement, reporting - must all be convertible with
  the rate set backing it, or the project cannot report at all.
* ``fx.pinned_set_resolvable``    - ERROR. A project pinned to a rate set must
  name one that exists and is locked. An unlocked pin is not a pin: the set can
  be rewritten by the next refresh and the "reproducible" estimate moves.
* ``fx.rate_freshness``           - WARNING. The backing set must be no older
  than the project's own tolerance.

Every rule reads the plain-dict context that
:meth:`app.modules.fx.service.FxService.build_validation_context` assembles, so
none of them needs a database session and all are unit-testable in isolation.
Rules stay silent (return no results) when there is nothing of their kind to
check - a project with no rate set on file must not bank a passing score from
checks that examined nothing.
