"""Tax withholding permission definitions.

``RequirePermission`` denies a permission nothing registered, and the admin
role short-circuits above that check. A module without this file therefore
ships endpoints that only an admin can reach, and every admin-authenticated
test still passes - so the file is load-bearing rather than paperwork.

Three keys, and the split follows who carries the consequence:

* ``tax_withholding.read`` is VIEWER. Knowing what was withheld from a payment
  is part of reading the payment.
* ``tax_withholding.write`` is EDITOR. Recording a party's standing and the
  deduction taken on a payment is ordinary commercial work.
* ``tax_withholding.manage`` is MANAGER, and covers the two things that are
  not. Editing a *scheme* changes the rate every future deduction is taken at,
  across every project at once; deleting a deduction or a standing removes the
  evidence behind a figure that has been remitted to a tax authority.
