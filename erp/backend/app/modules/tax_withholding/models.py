"""Tax withholding ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_tax_withholding_regime         - a statutory withholding scheme
    oe_tax_withholding_party          - one party's standing under a scheme
    oe_tax_withholding_deduction      - tax withheld from one payment
    oe_tax_withholding_reverse_charge - who accounts for the VAT on one invoice

**The word "withholding" already means something else in this codebase, twice,
and neither of them is a tax.** ``finance.Payment.withholding_amount`` and
``finance.Payment.withholding_release_date`` mean *retainage*: money held back
from a certified claim and paid to the payee later, typically at practical
completion. ``finance/retention_ledger.py`` and
``finance/service.py::compute_payment_withholding`` frame it the same way, and
the ``subcontractors`` module carries its own copy of the concept
(``RetentionLedger``, ``PaymentApplication.retention_amount``,
``SubcontractAgreement.retention_percent``).

Tax withheld under a statutory scheme is never released to the payee - it goes
to the state and the payee reclaims it through their own return. Retainage
always comes back. They are different obligations that happen to share an
English word, so **no column here is a bare ``withholding_amount``**: the money
column is ``tax_withheld``, the figure it is computed on is ``taxable_base``.
Retainage is already implemented in ``finance`` and ``subcontractors`` and is
not rebuilt here.

``payroll`` has a third, unrelated use: employee payroll tax deducted from a
payslip. This module withholds from a *supplier's invoice*, not from a wage.

Money is :class:`~decimal.Decimal` in a ``MoneyType`` column and is serialised
as a string by the schema layer. Every money-carrying row names its own
currency: a scheme that only exists because the work crosses a border cannot
have an implied one.

Nothing is ever queried *inside* a JSON column. On PostgreSQL a ``.contains()``
against a plain JSON column compiles to a string LIKE rather than to JSONB
containment, so a filter written that way would silently mean something else.
``bands`` is read whole and filtered in Python.
