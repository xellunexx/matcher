"""Shipped withholding schemes and reverse-charge rules.

Seed data, not a migration. A rate change or a new country is then an ordinary
code change that ships with a release, reviewable in a diff, instead of a
schema revision that can only run once; and an operator who has edited a rate
for their own reasons keeps that edit, because seeding only fills gaps.

Two catalogues, and they are different shapes on purpose:

* :data:`WITHHOLDING_REGIMES` becomes rows in ``oe_tax_withholding_regime``.
  A regime is a record with a life - parties are attached to it and deductions
  quote it - so it has to exist in the database.
* :data:`REVERSE_CHARGE_RULES` stays a lookup. A reverse charge is decided per
  invoice, and what the catalogue supplies is the statutory wording and the
  legal reference to copy onto that invoice. There is no reverse-charge
  *record* to keep between invoices, so there is no table for one.

``materials_excluded`` and ``vat_excluded`` are set per scheme and are not a
house style. They differ between countries and getting them wrong is the
expensive failure this module exists to prevent:

* The UK scheme deducts on labour only, so materials leave the base. Deducting
  on the gross over-withholds on every payment a subcontractor supplies
  materials on, and they only recover it at the end of their tax year.
* The German scheme is the opposite on both counts: section 48 EStG deducts
  from the *Gegenleistung*, which is the consideration including VAT, with no
  carve-out for materials.

Rates and thresholds are as published at the time of writing and are
deliberately data rather than code. Verify them against the authority before
relying on a figure for a filing.
