"""Background Jobs API routes - RFC 34 §4 W0.1.

Endpoints (all prefixed at ``/api/v1/jobs`` by the module loader):

    GET    /{id}            - Read a single JobRun row.
    GET    /                - Paginated list, filterable by kind & status.
    POST   /{id}/cancel     - Best-effort cancel (status to 'cancelled' if
                              still pending or started; revoke the Celery
                              task; no-op for already-finished jobs).

The router is intentionally read-mostly. Job *creation* happens via
:func:`app.core.job_runner.submit_job` from the modules that own the
work - exposing a generic POST /jobs would let callers request any
``kind`` they like, which is a footgun.
