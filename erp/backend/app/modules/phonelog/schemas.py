"""Phone-log Pydantic schemas - request/response models.

The create schema accepts a raw, free-form capture: the caller posts whatever it
has (a party line, an informal direction hint, a couple of timestamps or a
duration, the transcript, an optional summary) and the server normalizes it via
app.modules.phonelog.normalize before storing. The response carries the cleaned,
canonical record.
