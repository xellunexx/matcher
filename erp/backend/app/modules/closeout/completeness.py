"""Pure completeness maths and localized status labels for closeout packages.

The closeout service derives a package completeness percentage (delivered
required slots over required slots) inline in several places, and its slot and
package status words were English only. These helpers give that logic one
guarded, tested home and a plain-language, localized surface a UI can use, with
no database, ORM, or ``app.*`` import so they unit-test on any runner.

Nothing here is currency or locale specific: a closeout package is measured in
plain counts, and dates elsewhere in the module are ISO 8601.
