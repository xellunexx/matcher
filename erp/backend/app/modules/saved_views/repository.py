"""Data access for the saved-views module.

Pure CRUD on the ``SavedView`` / ``SavedViewRun`` rows ONLY. The repository never
runs a user view (that is the builder's job). Every list method is itself scoped
to an owner / project so the CRUD surface cannot leak other users' saved-view
DEFINITIONS either.
