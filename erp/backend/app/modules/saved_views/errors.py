"""Typed exceptions for the saved-views engine.

Each safety primitive raises its own exception so the router can map it to the
correct HTTP status and so a reviewer can trace a refusal back to the gate that
produced it:

    * :class:`RegistrationError` - a queryable entity was registered without a
      scoper, with a duplicate type, or with a field that does not resolve to a
      real mapped column. Raised at module startup, never at request time.
    * :class:`ScopeDenied` - the mandatory scoper refused outright (primitive 1).
      Surfaces as HTTP 404 to avoid an existence oracle, mirroring
      :func:`app.dependencies.verify_project_access`.
    * :class:`WhitelistError` - a spec referenced a column / operator that is not
      whitelisted for the target entity (primitive 2). Surfaces as HTTP 422.
    * :class:`BudgetError` - a spec exceeded the static complexity ceiling, the
      row cap, or the statement timeout (primitive 3). Surfaces as HTTP 422.
    * :class:`DuplicateViewName` - the owner already has a view of that name on
      that project and entity. Surfaces as HTTP 409.
