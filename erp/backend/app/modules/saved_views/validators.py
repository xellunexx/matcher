"""Saved-views module validation rules.

A saved view outlives the register it was written against. Fields get renamed,
enum vocabularies get pruned, whole modules get disabled - and the stored spec
keeps sitting there looking healthy. The danger is not that such a view fails;
it is that it might quietly succeed against a different question from the one
the estimator saved. The run path already refuses a spec that no longer binds,
so nothing silently returns the wrong rows. These rules are how the drift is
found BEFORE someone clicks, so a list of views can mark the broken ones
instead of turning a dashboard into a row of identical 422s.

All rules register under the ``saved_views`` rule set and self-select by the
``scope`` carried on the validated data.

View scope (``scope == "view"``, one stored definition plus the registry facts
about the entity it queries):

* ``saved_views.entity_registered``   - ERROR. The entity type is no longer in
                                        the registry, so the view cannot run at
                                        all.
* ``saved_views.spec_parses``         - ERROR. The stored JSON no longer parses
                                        as a filter spec.
* ``saved_views.fields_whitelisted``  - ERROR. The spec names a field the entity
                                        no longer whitelists.
* ``saved_views.field_capability``    - ERROR. The field still exists but may no
                                        longer be filtered, sorted, selected or
                                        grouped the way the spec uses it.
* ``saved_views.enum_values_current`` - ERROR. A filter compares an enum field
                                        against a value that has left the
                                        vocabulary, so it can only ever match
                                        nothing.
* ``saved_views.share_scope_known``   - ERROR. An unrecognised share scope is
                                        treated as private, hiding a view its
                                        owner believes is shared.
* ``saved_views.team_share_has_team`` - ERROR. A team share whose team is gone
                                        reaches nobody but its owner.
* ``saved_views.shared_view_pinned``  - ERROR. A shared view with no project pin
                                        can never admit a second reader.
* ``saved_views.within_complexity_budget`` - WARNING. The spec is close to or
                                        over the static complexity ceiling.
* ``saved_views.page_size_within_cap`` - WARNING. The requested page size is
                                        above the entity cap and will be clamped
                                        without saying so.
* ``saved_views.spec_is_not_empty``   - WARNING. Nothing was actually saved: no
                                        filter, no sort, no column choice.
* ``saved_views.shared_view_described`` - INFO. A view shared with other people
                                        and no description makes them guess.

The rules are pure and DB-free: :mod:`app.modules.saved_views.service` builds
the plain-dict payload from the stored row plus the registry and calls
:func:`evaluate_view`. :func:`describe_staleness` is the same structural core
without the engine, cheap enough to run over every row of a list response.
