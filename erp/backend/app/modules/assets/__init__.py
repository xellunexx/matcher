"""Asset Operations module.

Operational-phase intelligence layered on the BIM-sourced asset register.
The BIM Hub owns the data (``oe_bim_element``); this module owns the
computed *meaning* of that data: warranty / maintenance / lifecycle
health, portfolio roll-ups, candidate discovery, and warranty-expiry
alerting through the notifications module.

Design rule: this module persists nothing of its own. Every piece of
state (manufacturer, warranty date, service-log entries) lives inside the
existing ``BIMElement.asset_info`` JSON and is written through the BIM Hub
PATCH endpoint, so no Alembic migration is required to ship it.
