"""Asset-candidate discovery from BIM element data.

The Asset Register is empty until a human flags BIM elements as tracked
assets - one at a time, in the 3D viewer. That makes the whole module
dead-on-arrival for a real model with thousands of elements.

This module scores each BIM element on how likely it is to be a real-world
*managed* asset (a pump, an air-handling unit, a door, a fire extinguisher)
versus pure geometry (a wall, a slab). It is a pure function of the
element's category / type / family / properties, so it is fully unit
-tested and never touches the DB.

The result feeds a "Discover assets" flow: the user reviews ranked
candidates and bulk-promotes the real ones. AI-suggests / human-confirms -
nothing is auto-flagged.
