"""Asset Operations module manifest.

Operational-phase intelligence on top of the BIM-sourced asset register.
This module never owns its own tables. It reads tracked assets straight
from the shared ``oe_bim_element`` / ``oe_bim_model`` tables (populated by
the BIM Hub) and computes lifecycle / warranty / maintenance state from
the ``asset_info`` JSON blob already persisted there. Writes (promoting a
candidate, logging a service event) ride the existing BIM Hub PATCH
endpoint, so no schema migration is required.
