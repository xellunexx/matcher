"""Scheduled custom-agent runs (Item 29).

A custom agent can carry a 5-field POSIX cron expression in its
``automation`` envelope. The platform polls once a minute for agents whose
``automation.next_run_at`` is due and fires a real :class:`AgentRun` for each,
then advances ``next_run_at`` to the next cron occurrence.

Design choices (architecture guide "LIGHTWEIGHT & SIMPLE"):

* **No new dependency.** Cron parsing reuses the hand-rolled parser the
  reporting module already ships (:func:`app.modules.reporting.cron.next_occurrence`),
  rather than pulling in ``croniter`` and its transitive deps.
* **In-process asyncio loop**, exactly like the existing KPI / reports
  schedulers in ``main.py`` - no Celery, single-process is acceptable for the
  single-tenant deploy. The central app lifespan wires :func:`start_scheduler`.
* **UTC everywhere.** ``next_run_at`` is an ISO-8601 UTC string. Cron fields
  are interpreted in UTC (the reporting parser's contract).
* **Determinism.** A scheduled run is a normal agent run: it spawns through the
  same loop, persists steps, and never auto-applies its output. If the operator
  has no LLM configured the run simply records ``failure_reason="no_llm"`` like
  any manual run - no silent action is ever taken.

Firing a scheduled run reuses the service's :meth:`AgentService.start_run`
path; ``tagged`` metadata (``automation_trigger="schedule"``) is left for a
future monitoring item - for now the run is identifiable by its ``agent_name``
(``custom:<id>``) and that it was not initiated by a user request.
