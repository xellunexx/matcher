"""Event-triggered custom-agent runs (Item 29).

This wires the platform event bus to the agent automation envelope: when a
platform event fires (an RFI is created, a document is uploaded), every custom
agent that subscribed to the matching trigger is run automatically with the
event's context. This is the piece the scheduler module's docstring deferred to
"a later wave" - it is now live, so the trigger catalogue in
:mod:`app.modules.ai_agents.triggers` marks those events ``available=True``.

Design choices (consistent with the rest of the module):

* **Reuse, no new machinery.** Each handler runs the subscribed agents through
  the same :meth:`AgentService.start_run` path the scheduler uses, tagged
  ``trigger_source="event:<trigger>"`` so the monitoring panel and audit trail
  can tell event-fired runs apart from manual/scheduled ones.
* **Human-confirmed, never auto-applied.** An event-fired run produces the same
  reviewable proposal as any other run - it writes nothing to the BOQ/project.
  The architecture guide's "AI-augmented, human-confirmed" rule is absolute.
* **Fail-soft.** A handler opens its own session (the publisher's session is
  long gone for a detached publish), awaits each subscribed agent's run
  sequentially to bound LLM concurrency, and never raises out - one bad agent
  must not poison the event bus for every other subscriber.
* **Runs on behalf of the agent's creator.** ``start_run`` resolves a
  ``custom:<id>`` slug only for its owner, so firing under ``agent.user_id``
  keeps the per-user ownership model intact.

Subscriptions are registered at import time (the module loader imports
``events`` during module load, same contract as every other module's events).
