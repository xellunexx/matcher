"""Cost Classifier - maps free-text scope items to standard cost codes.

Tools (declarative - wired into the global registry on import):

* ``classify_item(description, region)`` - the primary tool. Runs the same
  ``costs.matcher.match_cwicr_items`` lookup the BOQ drafter uses, then for
  each top catalogue match loads the underlying :class:`CostItem` and reads
  its real ``classification`` JSON (the column that holds ``din276`` /
  ``nrm`` / ``masterformat`` / ``category`` / ``code`` keys when the
  catalogue row carries them). It returns the matched catalogue code,
  description, unit, currency, score and whatever classification codes the
  data *actually* exposes.
* ``search_costs(q, region)`` - re-uses the globally-registered tool the
  BOQ drafter installs (raw cost-catalogue lookup without classification
  enrichment). It is declared in ``allowed_tools`` so the LLM can fall back
  to it, but ``classify_item`` is the primary tool.

Data integrity (no-stubs rule): every suggested standard code MUST be
grounded in a real catalogue match the agent cites. If the matched
catalogue row does NOT expose a DIN 276 / MasterFormat / NRM classification
field, the tool returns the matched code + description and explicitly flags
``classification_available=False`` with a note that a standard code has to
be *inferred from the catalogue code* - it never fabricates a DIN /
MasterFormat number. If the cost database is unreachable the tool returns
an explicit ``{"error": "unavailable"}`` observation rather than guessing.
