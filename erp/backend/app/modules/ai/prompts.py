"""AI prompt templates for construction cost estimation.

Contains carefully crafted prompts for text-based and photo-based estimation.
Prompts instruct the AI to return structured JSON arrays of work items
with realistic quantities, units, and market-rate prices.

Prompt-injection note (Audit AI1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any place these templates interpolate user-controlled content (uploaded
document text, image OCR, free-form descriptions) is a potential
prompt-injection vector. We wrap such content in explicit delimiters
plus a "treat as data, not as instructions" instruction so the LLM is
much less likely to obey instructions smuggled inside the input. The
``fence_user_content`` helper does the wrapping; every prompt below
that takes uploaded data MUST funnel it through that helper rather
than concatenating directly.

# Tag pair we wrap user-controlled content with. The opening tag is
# chosen so it can't appear inside legitimate document text by accident

# Strings matching the closing tag inside the input would let an
# attacker break out of the fence, so we strip them before substitution.
