"""International, review-ready helpers for change orders.

These are pure functions with no database, network, or global state. They give
the change order module a small, well-documented vocabulary for the money and
status questions that come up on every construction project worldwide:

* what a change order is worth once its line items are priced and any markup /
  overhead-and-profit (OH&P) percentage is applied;
* how the priced change orders on a project group by their approval state;
* what those approved change orders do to the revised contract sum.

Design rules that keep the module correct for any country:

* Money is always ``Decimal``, never ``float``. Values round to 2 decimal
  places (HALF_UP) only at the presentation boundary, matching the rest of the
  module.
* No currency, tax rate, unit, or locale is hardcoded. Currency is carried
  alongside every amount and is never blended across different ISO codes: two
  amounts in different currencies are never summed without an explicit rate,
  which is out of scope for these helpers and raises a clean ``ValueError``.
* Every markup / OH&P / admin percentage is an explicit parameter with a
  documented default of zero, so a caller that says nothing gets the raw priced
  value and no silent uplift.
* Bad input surfaces as ``ValueError`` (a clean 400 for the API), never as a
  500, ``NaN``, or ``inf``. Division by zero, empty inputs, and mixed statuses
  are all handled with defined results.
* Outputs expose their components (net lines, markup, totals) so a reviewer or
  auditor can reconstruct every figure by hand.

# Which contractual instrument a change order is, as opposed to why it exists.
#
# The two questions are genuinely separate and the module already answers the
# second: ``reason_category`` says a design changed or a condition was
# unforeseen. This says what document is on the table, and the answer decides
# who signs it, what evidence it needs and which clause governs it. An
# unforeseen site condition can arrive as any of the three.
#
# The distinction is not a local one, though it is sharpest where a standard
# names the instruments. Chinese practice separates 工程变更, an instructed
# change to the works, from 现场签证, a record signed on site confirming that
# something happened and forming the basis of payment for it, from 索赔, a
# claim for time or money under the contract. The same three exist under the
# international contract standards as a variation, a confirmed site
# instruction or daywork record, and a claim. So the vocabulary is written in
# neutral terms rather than transliterated, and the front end labels it.
#
# ``works_change`` rather than ``variation`` on purpose: ``variations`` is a
# module in this codebase, and a value that repeats a module's name reads as a
# reference to it. The column is ``variation_type``, which would also have made
# ``variation`` tautological.
#
# What this is not derived from: the text of GB/T 50500-2024 could not be
# obtained. Commentary on the revision claims 现场签证 was dropped as a category,
# and that claim is unverified, so these three describe practice as it is
# conducted rather than a standard's current table of contents. If the text

    Only change orders in ``counted_status`` (``"approved"`` by default) move the
    contract sum: a submitted or rejected order is counted for context but adds
    nothing. The revised contract sum is the original plus the total of the
    counted orders, all in one currency.

    Args:
        original_contract_sum: the contract value before any change orders. Must
            be non-negative and finite.
        orders: an iterable exposing ``status``, ``cost_impact``, and optionally
            ``currency``. A genuine mix of currencies raises ``ValueError``.
        currency: the ISO currency both the contract sum and the orders are in.
        counted_status: the single status whose orders change the sum. Must be a
            known lifecycle state.

    The percentage change guards against a zero original contract sum: when the
    original is zero the ratio is undefined, so ``pct_defined`` is ``False`` and
    ``pct_change`` is zero rather than a division-by-zero crash.
