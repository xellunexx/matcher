"""Basis-of-estimate module.

Auto-drafts the inclusions, exclusions and assumptions that qualify an estimate,
derived from which trades are present, absent or flagged by the coverage check
over the finished BOQ. The drafted lines are editable and export with a proposal.

The reasoning engine (:mod:`app.modules.estimate_basis.derivation`) is
stdlib-only, so it can be unit tested on a bare interpreter without a database or
the app graph. Permission registration is deferred to :func:`on_startup`, called
by the module loader after the router is mounted.
