"""Work-type route classifier validation rules.

Ships one first-class rule registered with the platform rule registry:

* ``RouteDeterminedRule`` (ERROR) - a project must have a *confirmed* route
  assessment whose route is not ``undetermined`` before it proceeds. An
  unclassified or still-draft project is a blocking gap.

The rule runs against a plain dict context (no ORM), shaped by the service /
caller as ``{"assessments": [{status, determined_route}], "project_id": ...}``
(a single assessment dict or a bare list is also accepted). This keeps the rule
pure and trivially unit-testable while satisfying the platform "no module
without validation rules" requirement.
