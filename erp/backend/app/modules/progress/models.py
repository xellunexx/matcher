# CREATE SEQUENCE before the column that defaults from it, when it builds the

#
# The metadata attachment does NOT hand the sequence to the auto-migrator, and
# the comment here used to claim it did. create_all's visit_metadata keeps only
# the sequences whose .column is None; this one is passed to mapped_column, so
# its .column is set and it is filtered out, leaving CREATE TABLE as its only
# route - and that does not run for a table that already exists, which is
# exactly the population the auto-migrator heals. So on an upgraded install this
# sequence was absent when ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT nextval(...) ran, the seq
# column silently failed to land, and it failed again on every later boot: the
# breakage was permanent, not one boot long, and invisible on fresh installs.
# app.core.postgres_migrator._heal_sequences now creates it, and is the ONLY
# thing in the app-managed upgrade path that ever will. Do not delete it on the
# assumption that create_all covers this.

    """Append-only field measurement of percent-complete for a BOQ position.

    Design rationale
    ─────────────────
    * ``percent_complete`` is stored as NUMERIC(6,3) so 0.000 – 100.000 never
      suffer floating-point rounding. A CHECK constraint enforces the range at
      the DB level (belt + braces alongside the Pydantic [0, 100] validator).
    * Entries are *append-only*: to correct a mistake, record a new entry.
      The service layer always queries the *latest* entry for a position when
      computing current progress.
    * ``seq`` is what makes "latest" well defined. ``recorded_at`` defaults to
      the DB's ``now()``, which in PostgreSQL is the TRANSACTION timestamp, so
      every row written by one transaction shares it exactly; ``created_at``
      is a Python ``datetime.now()`` and ties too on a coarse clock. Without a
      monotonic column the winner among same-transaction rows fell to a random
      uuid, so a bulk-imported correction won only by luck. ``seq`` is
      strictly increasing per INSERT and orders those rows properly.
    * ``geo_lat`` / ``geo_lon`` capture the worker's location at record-time
      (optional - phone may not provide GPS in all conditions).
    * ``rework_cost`` is stored as VARCHAR so money is never a float.

    # Identity column, deliberately. Both produce the same thing under

    # `app.core.postgres_migrator` patches columns onto pre-existing tables by
    # reading `col.server_default`, and it has no notion of identity. With
    # Identity this column would land on an upgraded database as a plain
    # nullable BIGINT with no default - NULL on every row, old and new - and
    # "latest wins" would silently fall back to the tied timestamps this
    # column exists to replace. The fix would look installed and do nothing.

    # ``_progress_entry_seq.next_value()`` because the latter is compiled by
