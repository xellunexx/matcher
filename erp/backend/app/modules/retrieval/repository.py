"""Data access for saved searches.

Every read takes the owner's id as a required argument rather than inferring
it, so a caller cannot reach another user's pins by forgetting a filter. A pin
belonging to somebody else reads as absent, which lets the router answer 404
for both "no such row" and "not yours" and keeps the API from being usable to
probe for ids.

Reads use ``select()`` with an explicit owner predicate rather than
``session.get()``: ``session.get()`` answers from the identity map, so it can
hand back a row another statement in the same session already deleted, and it
cannot express the owner filter at all.
