"""Retrieval ORM models.

One table, ``oe_retrieval_saved_search``: a search the user pinned so they can
re-run it later. Until now the pin lived in the browser's ``localStorage``,
which meant a saved search was invisible to the same person on a second machine
and gone the moment the profile was cleared. The facets are stored as their own
columns rather than as one JSON blob, so the unique constraint, the indexes and
the validation rules can all address them directly.

Deliberately carries **no** ``relationship()``. The two foreign keys are read as
ids and nothing ever traverses from a saved search to its owner or its project,
so there is no collection to eager-load and no back-reference that could fire a
lazy SELECT out of the async greenlet. Should a caller ever need traversal, the
project rule applies: collections get ``lazy="selectin"`` and the child's
back-reference to its parent gets ``lazy="raise_on_sql"``.
