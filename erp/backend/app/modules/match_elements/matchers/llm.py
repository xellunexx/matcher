"""LLM matcher - AI re-rank over a vector-prefiltered candidate shortlist.

The match-elements service calls this when the user picks ``method="llm"``
on a group. Rather than asking the LLM to invent CWICR codes from thin
air (which hallucinates non-existent rates), this matcher follows the
"AI-augmented, human-confirmed" principle in two bounded steps:

1. **Recall** - the existing :class:`VectorMatcher` produces a shortlist
   of real catalogue rows for the group's envelope (dense + sparse fuse
   in Qdrant). These are guaranteed-valid candidates with real codes,
   units, and rates.
2. **Precision** - the shortlist (description + unit only, no rates) is
   handed to the LLM, which picks the best match and assigns a 0..1
   confidence. The LLM can only *choose among and re-order* the
   shortlist; it can never fabricate a code. We then reorder the real
   :class:`MatchCandidate` objects accordingly and stamp the LLM's
   confidence as the new score.

Honest degradation
------------------
When no AI provider key is configured (the common single-tenant case
before the user adds a key in Settings > AI), the matcher does NOT raise
and does NOT return a misleading empty result. It falls back to the
vector candidates unchanged, tags each with a ``boosts_applied`` note
(``llm_unavailable``) and logs a single warning. The user still gets the
deterministic vector ranking; the only thing missing is the AI re-order.
This is the most honest behaviour: the feature works, just without the
optional AI tier, exactly like the BGE reranker degrades when the
cross-encoder weights are absent.

Token budget
------------
Only the top :data:`_SHORTLIST_SIZE` candidates are sent, and only their
``code`` / ``description`` / ``unit`` (never the rate - price must not
bias a *relevance* judgement). The prompt asks for a compact JSON array,
capped at ``max_tokens=600``. One LLM round-trip per group; the service
already batches by capping ``max_groups`` per run.
