"""International, database-free reporting helpers for the transmittals module.

Everything here is a plain function or small dataclass with no database, clock
or network access, so it can be unit tested in isolation and reused by the
service, router and reporting layers. The goal is a set of transmittal figures
that read the same for a document controller anywhere in the world:

    - No hardcoded locale. Words are localized on request (en / de / ru) and
      fall back to English for any other language, so nothing is ever shown as
      a raw code.
    - All dates are ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). A stored value may also be a full
      ISO timestamp (the service records the issue moment as
      ``datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()``); only the calendar-date part is used.
    - The acknowledgement SLA is always a parameter, never assumed, because
      "how many days to acknowledge" is a project and contract decision.

Every figure guards its edge cases: nothing issued, empty sets, negative
counts or a reply dated before the issue date all resolve to a well-defined
value or a clean :class:`ValueError`, never a 500, a NaN, an infinity or a
misleading negative. Any rate stays inside [0, 1] (and its percent twin inside
[0, 100]). Each result also exposes the components it was derived from, so a
reader can see exactly how the number was reached.
