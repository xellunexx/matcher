"""Resource-assignment validation rules.

An assignment can now name the schedule activity it staffs. That link is only
worth having if something reads it and objects, so these rules are that reader:

* ``resources.assignment_outside_activity_window`` - WARNING. The assignment
  names an activity but is booked partly or wholly outside that activity's own
  dates, so the histogram loads a bar the work does not sit on.
* ``resources.assignment_target_ambiguous`` - WARNING. The assignment names
  both a schedule activity and a to-do task. Those are two different objects
  in two different registers; an assignment that means both means neither.
* ``resources.assignment_activity_missing`` - WARNING. The assignment names an
  activity the caller looked for and did not find, which is what a deleted
  activity id looks like from here. Not a cross-project one: the lookup is not
  project-scoped, so an activity in another project resolves and this rule
  stays quiet about it.

The rules take a plain dict rather than ORM instances so they stay unit
testable without a session. The caller assembles it, because a rule has no
database of its own:

    {
        "assignment": Assignment,
        "activity": Activity | None,
        "activity_lookup_available": bool,
    }

``activity`` is None both when the assignment names no activity and when it
names one that could not be loaded. Those two cases are not the same and the
rules tell them apart by reading ``assignment.activity_id``, never by the
absence of the activity alone.

``activity_lookup_available`` separates a third case that otherwise hides
inside the second: on an install without the schedule module there is nothing
to look the activity up in, so every assignment carrying an ``activity_id``
would be accused of staffing a deleted bar. False means the caller could not
ask the question, and a rule that needs the answer stays quiet. It defaults to
True when absent, so a payload written before this key existed keeps its
meaning.

Registration follows the module convention: :func:`register_resources_rules`
is idempotent, is called from the module's ``on_startup`` hook, and is called
again by the tests because no test process runs application startup.
