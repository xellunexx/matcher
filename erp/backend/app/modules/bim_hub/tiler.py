"""BIM geometry tiler - split a monolithic model GLB into streaming tiles.

Why
---
Today the viewer downloads one GLB for the whole building and parses it
synchronously on the main thread. On a large model that is a 50-150 MB
transfer and a 20-40 s UI freeze, and the browser is told ``no-store`` so it
happens again on every visit. On a job-site tablet over cellular that is the
difference between usable and not.

This module bakes that same model into spatially-partitioned tiles once, so
the viewer can stream geometry progressively (nearest-camera / current-storey
first), parse each tile off the main thread, and cache tiles forever because
they are content-addressed and therefore immutable.

Design
------
Pure geometry, no DB or storage coupling: :func:`build_tileset` takes GLB
bytes and returns a manifest dict plus a ``{content_hash: glb_bytes}`` map.
The service layer owns persistence and the HTTP layer owns delivery. The old
monolithic-GLB path is untouched and stays the fallback for models that were
never tiled, are too small to benefit, or are too large to tile safely.

Tiles preserve the original glTF node names, so the viewer's existing
mesh-node -> BIM element matching (by ``stable_id`` / ``mesh_ref`` / name)
works unchanged on a streamed tile - no frontend rework to keep selection,
isolate, and colour-by-property functioning.

The partition is a plain adaptive octree over per-mesh bounding-box centres:
a cell subdivides into its eight octants until it holds at most
``max_meshes_per_tile`` meshes or the depth cap is reached, with a degenerate
guard so a pile of co-located meshes cannot spin the recursion. If the result
overshoots :data:`MAX_TILES_PER_MODEL` the threshold is relaxed and the model
repartitioned, so tile count stays bounded on very large models. World
transforms are baked into each tile mesh so a tile is self-contained in world
space and the frontend just drops it into the scene at the origin.

Tile granularity is a delivery decision, not a cosmetic one: the threshold has
to stay below :data:`MIN_NODES_TO_TILE` or the smallest models we tile come out
as a single tile and stream no better than the monolith. See the comment on
:data:`DEFAULT_MAX_MESHES_PER_TILE`.

# Bumping this invalidates every previously baked tileset (the service keys
# stored manifests by version, so old tiles are simply re-baked on demand).
TILER_VERSION = "1.1"

# Below this mesh count the monolithic GLB already loads fast; tiling would
# only add manifest + per-tile request overhead, so we skip it and let the
# caller serve the monolith.
MIN_NODES_TO_TILE = 400

# Loading a multi-hundred-MB GLB into trimesh peaks at several times its size
# in RAM. Above this we refuse to tile to protect the worker; the monolith
# path (streamed from disk with Range support) still serves the model.
MAX_GLB_BYTES = 400 * 1024 * 1024

# An octree cell stops subdividing once it holds at most this many meshes.
#
# INVARIANT: this MUST stay below MIN_NODES_TO_TILE. The octree returns a cell
# whole as soon as it holds at most this many meshes, so if the threshold sits
# at or above the tiling floor then every model in the band just above that
# floor collapses into a single tile - a "tileset" that costs a manifest round
# trip to deliver exactly the monolithic GLB, with the viewer's progressive
# reveal firing once, at the end. That was the case until 1.1 (the threshold
# was 1200 against a floor of 400), which silently disabled streaming for every
# model between 400 and 1200 meshes.
#
# 300 is measured rather than guessed. On a real 719-mesh model it yields 19
# tiles instead of 1, dropping the bytes before the first tile can appear from
# 2 643 KB to 33 KB, and it costs 6.6% in total payload (2.58 MB monolithic ->
# 2.75 MB of tiles) from per-tile glTF headers and duplicated materials.
DEFAULT_MAX_MESHES_PER_TILE = 300

# Hard recursion cap so a pathological centroid distribution cannot spin.
DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH = 7

# Upper bound on tiles per model. Each tile is a separate HTTP request, so on a
# high-latency site connection a very large model partitioned too finely trades
# a bandwidth win for a round-trip loss. When the partition overshoots we relax
# the per-tile mesh threshold and repartition; the octree runs on centroids
# only and is cheap, and the expensive GLB export happens once, afterwards.
