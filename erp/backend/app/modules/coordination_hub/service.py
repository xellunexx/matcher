# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Read-only aggregator for the Coordination Hub dashboard.

The service issues lightweight per-category SELECT-COUNT statements (one
per data point) against the existing sibling-module tables. There is
NEVER a Python-side join, an ORM hydration of a list and a manual
``len()``, or an N+1 - every count is its own ``func.count()`` query.

Each sub-count is wrapped in :func:`_safe_count` so a missing table /
mid-migration deploy / dropped dependency on a smaller install never
takes the whole dashboard down. The contract is "honest zero + a
WARNING log line", not "500 + scary stack trace".

That contract covers the optional-module imports too. A module that was
never installed is the expected condition and stays at DEBUG; a module
that IS installed and failed is logged with its traceback through
:func:`_optional_module_unavailable`. A zero the operator cannot tell
apart from a real zero is not an honest zero.

A small in-memory dict caches the assembled dashboard payload per
project for ``_DASHBOARD_TTL_SECONDS`` so the polling UI does not slam
the count queries on every tick.
