"""CVR validation guards (first-class, pure, DB-free).

Two rules matter for a Cost-Value Reconciliation:

1. **Single currency (hard).** Every line of a report is expressed in the
   report's own currency; a line that declares a different currency is rejected
   outright so totals are never summed across currencies.
2. **Forecast sanity (advisory).** A final forecast should not fall below what
   has already been spent (``cost_to_date``) or earned (``value_to_date``). This
   is a *soft* flag: the service surfaces it on the line and in the summary
   ``warnings`` rather than blocking the write, because an in-progress CVR can
   legitimately carry a not-yet-updated forecast.

Everything here is a pure function so the unit suite asserts on it without a
database or a session.
