"""Review-authority validation rules.

Ships one first-class rule with the platform rule registry:

* ``ReviewCycleCompletenessRule`` (ERROR) - a review cycle that has been
  submitted must carry a pinned document version, and must not be moved to a
  final approved decision while remarks are still unresolved (``open`` or
  ``responded``). Both are blocking gaps in the review record.

The rule runs against a plain dict context (no ORM), shaped by the service /
caller as::

    {
        "cycle": {"status": ..., "pinned_document_version": ...},
        "remarks": [{"ordinal": ..., "status": ...}, ...],
    }

Keeping it pure makes it trivially unit-testable and satisfies the platform
"no module without validation rules" requirement.

NOTE: the shared rule file ``app/core/validation/rules/__init__.py`` is NOT
edited by this module; the rule is defined here and registered at module
startup via :func:`register_review_authority_validation_rules`, exactly as the
closeout module does. If the platform later moves to central registration, this
rule class is ready to be referenced from there unchanged.
