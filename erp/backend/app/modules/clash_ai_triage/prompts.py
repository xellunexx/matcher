"""Prompt templates for LLM-assisted clash triage.

WHY THIS FILE IS IN THE REPO
============================
Competitive BIM coordination tools ship "AI clash triage"
as a paid black box - you cannot see the prompt, you cannot tune it,
you cannot reason about why a verdict was produced. OpenConstructionERP
takes the opposite stance: the prompt lives HERE, in version control,
and a coordinator who reads English can audit every word the LLM is
asked to consider.

You can tune the wording for your project (e.g. a hospital project might
want stricter penetration rules, a residential one might want softer
tolerance treatment) by editing the strings below and bumping
``PROMPT_VERSION``. The triage service writes ``prompt_version`` onto
every persisted result so a re-run with a tightened prompt produces a
NEW triage row instead of silently overwriting the audit trail.

STRUCTURE
=========
Two templates are used per LLM call:

* ``SYSTEM_PROMPT_V1`` - sets the assistant's persona, declares the
  STRICT JSON schema the model must return, and lists the
  category-discrimination rules in plain English.
* ``USER_PROMPT_V1`` - interpolates the actual clash's evidence (element
  types, materials, trade pair, clearance, location, prior triage if
  this is a re-run) into a fact sheet for the LLM to reason against.

The model is asked to return JSON ONLY - no prose, no markdown code
fences. The service layer still parses defensively (extract JSON from
markdown fences as a fallback) but a well-behaved model honours the
"no commentary" rule on the very first try.

SAFETY
======
``build_user_prompt`` runs every interpolated value through a strict
sanitiser (``_sanitise``) so a malicious or buggy upstream cannot inject
prompt-control sequences (e.g. ``"Ignore previous instructions and …"``
or backtick-fenced fake JSON) into the LLM's input. Long fields are
truncated at ``_MAX_FIELD_CHARS`` so a 5 MB ``properties`` blob never
blows the model's context budget.
