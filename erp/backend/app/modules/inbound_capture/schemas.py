"""Pydantic schemas for the inbound capture API.

The request bodies stay deliberately permissive: the pure
:mod:`~app.modules.inbound_capture.normalize` engine already tolerates missing /
oddly-named fields and maps each channel's ad-hoc payload onto one canonical
shape, so the schemas accept an open ``payload`` dict (the already-parsed email
headers / body, or the provider's webhook / SMS JSON) rather than re-declaring
every channel's field set here. The response mirrors the normalized
:class:`~app.modules.inbound_capture.normalize.InboundMessage` plus the id of the
correspondence row it was persisted as, so a caller can confirm what was stored
and follow the link into the Correspondence module.
