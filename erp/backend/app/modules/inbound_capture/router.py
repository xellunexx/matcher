"""Inbound capture API routes (auto-mounted at /api/v1/inbound-capture).

Two capture endpoints turn an outside message into incoming correspondence:

* ``POST /email`` - an already-parsed inbound email payload.
* ``POST /{provider}/webhook`` - a provider chat / SMS webhook delivery, whose
  signature is verified against the RAW request body before the body is trusted.

Both normalize the payload with the pure inbound engine, persist it as an
incoming ``oe_correspondence`` row, publish ``correspondence.created`` and are
idempotent on the provider's external message id.

Auth: these endpoints may be called by an external system rather than an
interactive user, but they are still NOT anonymous. The caller must present a
valid platform token whose role grants ``inbound.write`` (the
``dependencies=[RequirePermission(...)]`` gate, copied from the cost-recovery
router), and the target project must pass :func:`verify_project_access` - which
404s on both "missing" and "denied" so it never leaks project existence. Webhook
deliveries additionally carry a provider HMAC signature, verified by the seam
below. The desired public path for these routes is ``/api/v1/inbound/...``; the
loader derives the mount from the package directory, so today they land under
``/api/v1/inbound-capture/...`` (see the module REPORT for the one-line tweak to
move them to ``/inbound``).

# request body bytes and comparing it, in constant time, to the signature the
# provider sent. The verifying secret is supplied out of band (never stored in
# the DB) via a per-provider environment variable, so adding a provider is a
# config change, not a code change. The seam is intentionally a single small,
# well-named function: extend it per provider by branching on ``provider`` (e.g.
# a provider that signs ``timestamp.body`` instead of ``body``, or sends the
# digest base64 instead of hex) - the call site never changes.
