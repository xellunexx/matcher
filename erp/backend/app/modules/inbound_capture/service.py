"""Inbound capture service - persist a normalized inbound message as correspondence.

The pure :mod:`~app.modules.inbound_capture.normalize` engine has already
flattened the channel payload to a canonical
:class:`~app.modules.inbound_capture.normalize.InboundMessage`. This thin layer
persists that message as an ``oe_correspondence`` row with ``direction =
incoming`` and announces it on the same ``correspondence.created`` event the
Correspondence module publishes, so the vector indexer and the comms digest see
captured messages exactly as they see hand-entered ones.

Two platform conventions are load-bearing here:

* Writes FLUSH, never commit. The request-scoped session dependency
  (:data:`app.dependencies.SessionDep`) commits after the handler returns and
  rolls back on error, so a failed capture leaves no half-written row.
* Capture is IDEMPOTENT on the provider's own message id. The same delivery
  captured twice (a retried webhook, a re-imported ``.eml``) shares a channel
  and external id, hence the engine's :func:`idempotency_key`; we look that key
  up first and return the existing row rather than inserting a duplicate.

Channel / external id storage
-----------------------------
The ``oe_correspondence`` table has no ``channel`` or ``external_message_id``
column, so this service stores both (plus the idempotency key and the rest of
the normalized envelope) under the row's ``metadata_`` JSON. That keeps the
module migration-free and mirrors how the cost-recovery service reads
``metadata_['traceability_band']``. If first-class columns are added later (see
the module REPORT), the idempotency lookup below is the one place that changes.
