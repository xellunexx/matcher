"""Pure glue between a contract and the e-signature registry.

The signing module is deliberately subject-neutral: it knows a ``document_ref``
and a ``document_content_hash`` and nothing about what was signed. Everything
that turns a contract into those two strings lives here, in functions that take
plain rows and return plain values, so the whole bridge is testable without a
session and without the signing module being installed at all.

Why the content hash is computed here and not in ``signing``
===========================================================
``delta_by_hash`` in ``signing.service`` answers "whose signature went stale
because the paper moved on". It compares each attestation's ``content_hash``
against the session's current ``document_content_hash``, so it can only ever
fire if somebody recomputes and pushes that hash when the paper changes. The
signing module cannot do that: it has no way to look at a contract. So the
recompute is a contract-side duty, and ``ContractsService.update_contract``
discharges it. Without that call the staleness machinery reads as working while
being structurally unable to fire, which is worse than not having it.

What the hash covers, and why that exact set
============================================
The legally material body of the contract: its identity, its parties, its money,
its dates, its retention terms and the template version it was drawn from.
Deliberately excluded are ``status``, ``signed_at``, ``metadata_`` and the
timestamps: those move *because* of signing, and folding them in would make
every signature stale the moment the next one is recorded.
