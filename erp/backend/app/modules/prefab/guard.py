"""Off-site / Prefab / DfMA production stage machine.

Pure, database-free rules for the linear off-site production lifecycle::

    design -> approved_for_production -> in_production -> qa
           -[QA gate]-> dispatched -> delivered -> installed

The machine encodes only the *rules*; persistence of a unit's current stage is
the caller's responsibility (see ``PrefabService.advance_stage``). It mirrors
the stateless design of :class:`app.core.cde_states.CDEStateMachine`.

The one hard gate is quality: a unit may not be dispatched, delivered or
installed until it has reached the ``qa`` stage. Off-site manufacturing lives
or dies on that check - shipping a volumetric module that never cleared factory
QA is the exact failure this guard exists to prevent.
