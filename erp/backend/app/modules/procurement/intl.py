"""International, framework-free procurement helpers.

This module holds small, side-effect-free helpers that make procurement money
and delivery math correct and clear for users anywhere in the world. It has no
database, no FastAPI, and no third-party dependency, so it imports and runs the
same in a unit test as it does in the request path.

Design rules that keep the platform usable worldwide:

* No hardcoded currency, tax rate, unit, or locale. Every rate is a parameter
  with a documented default of "no tax / no discount" so a caller in any
  country supplies their own figure.
* Money is Decimal-exact. Amounts never touch ``float`` and never drift.
* Money is never summed across different currency codes. Mixing codes is a
  clean input error, not a silently-wrong total.
* Dates are ISO 8601 (``YYYY-MM-DD``). Quantities always carry an explicit
  unit label so "100" is never ambiguous.
* Bad input (garbage numbers, negative quantities, division by zero) is turned
  into a clear ``ValueError`` or a well-defined zero. It never becomes a 500,
  a NaN, or an infinity.

The service layer keeps its own ``HTTPException``-raising helpers. These
functions raise plain ``ValueError`` so they stay reusable outside a request
(reports, exports, background jobs, tests). A caller in the router can wrap a
``ValueError`` in a 400 if it reaches the API edge.
