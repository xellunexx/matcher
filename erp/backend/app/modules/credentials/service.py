"""Business logic for the professional-credentials registry.

Two services live here.

:class:`CredentialService` owns the individual credential: deriving its
``status`` from its validity window, and firing a ``credentials.expiry.alert``
event the moment a credential *transitions* into an alerting bucket so a
notification subscriber can warn the team before a licence lapses.

The status rule is applied on write *and* on every read. Nothing rewrites a row
as the calendar moves past it, so the stored column is only ever as fresh as the
last edit; treating it as the answer is what let a credential entered a year ago
report itself active forty days after it expired. The column survives as an
index-friendly cache that ``refresh_statuses`` converges when asked, never as a
side effect of a GET. Its SQL twin lives in the repository, and the two are
pinned against each other by test, because a filter and a label that disagree
produce output in which nothing looks wrong.

:class:`RequirementService` owns what the project demands: which credential
types are required of whom, and the compliance report that joins requirements to
holders to answer who may not work today. A missing credential, a lapsed one
past its grace window and a suspended one all block; an upcoming expiry never
does, because a ticket valid until Friday is valid today.

Both are jurisdiction-neutral - the country-specific "notify authority within N
days" content is carried as data on the row, never as logic here.
