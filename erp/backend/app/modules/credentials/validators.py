"""Credentials-registry validation rules.

A register of tickets is only worth keeping if something reads it and objects.
These rules are that reader. They run over one project's credentials, the
requirements the project sets, and the compliance report joining the two, and
they answer the questions a site manager would ask on a Monday morning:

* ``credentials.blocking_gap``          - ERROR. Somebody on the register cannot
                                          work today: a blocking requirement is
                                          unmet, expired past its grace window,
                                          suspended or revoked.
* ``credentials.notification_overdue``  - ERROR. A statutory notification window
                                          has closed with nothing recorded
                                          against it.
* ``credentials.expiring_window``       - WARNING. A credential has entered its
                                          own reminder window and needs renewing.
* ``credentials.no_expiry_recorded``    - WARNING. A credential of a family that
                                          normally lapses carries no expiry date,
                                          so nothing can ever warn about it.
* ``credentials.unverified_blocking``   - WARNING. A blocking requirement is
                                          satisfied only by a credential nobody
                                          has checked against its authority.
* ``credentials.duplicate_identifier``  - WARNING. One authority and identifier
                                          recorded twice, which double-counts a
                                          holder's cover.
* ``credentials.unmatched_requirement`` - WARNING. A requirement that binds
                                          nobody on the register: usually a
                                          discipline typo, and always a rule that
                                          silently measures nothing.

Every rule is jurisdiction-neutral. None of them knows what a country requires;
they read the requirements the project itself has recorded. The one date rule
that looks statutory (``notification_overdue``) reads the window off the row.

The rules take their input as a plain dict rather than ORM instances so they
stay unit-testable without a session:

    {
        "today": date,
        "credentials": [Credential, ...],
        "requirements": [CredentialRequirement, ...],
        "compliance": ComplianceReport,
    }

Registration follows the module convention: :func:`register_credentials_rules`
is idempotent and is called from the module's ``on_startup`` hook, and from the
test suite's session fixture because no test process runs application startup.
