"""Professional-credentials data-access layer.

Holds the SQL half of the one status rule. :func:`effective_status_expr` is the
database mirror of :func:`app.modules.credentials.service.recompute_status`, and
the two must agree for every input - a register that filters rows by one rule
and labels them by another is worse than one that is merely stale, because the
disagreement is invisible. ``tests/modules/credentials/test_credentials_status_agreement.py``
drives a matrix through both and fails the moment they diverge.

Why an expression rather than the stored column: ``status`` is written only when
someone writes to the row. A credential that simply ages into its reminder
window is never written to, so every query that trusts the stored column misses
exactly the rows the register exists to surface.
