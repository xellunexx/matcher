"""Professional-credentials registry ORM model.

Tables:
    oe_credentials_credential - a project-scoped register of the professional
        credentials a delivery relies on: licences, certifications, statutory
        memberships, professional indemnity, trade/registration cards and
        training. Each row carries a validity window and a reminder threshold
        so the platform can warn before a credential lapses, plus an optional
        statutory-notification obligation (the "notify the authority within N
        days of appointment" duty that exists, in different forms, in most
        jurisdictions).
    oe_credentials_requirement - what the project *demands*. A credential row
        on its own can only answer "does this ticket expire soon". Answering
        "who may not work today" needs the other half: which credential types
        are required, of whom, and whether a gap stops work or merely warrants
        a note. Requirements are matched to credentials by ``credential_type``
        rather than by a foreign key, because a requirement exists precisely
        when the matching credential does *not*.

Why a dedicated register
========================
Three narrower certification tables already exist elsewhere (per-resource,
per-safety-worker, per-subcontractor). None answers the cross-cutting question
this register does: "for THIS project, which people and firms hold which
credentials, are any about to lapse, and do we owe an authority a notification".
It is deliberately jurisdiction-neutral - it stores *what* the credential is and
*when* it is valid, never a country's rule. Per-country vocabularies (which
authority, which statutory window) come from the regional packs.

Design
======
- Tenancy is by ``project_id`` (non-null, cascade delete), mirroring
  :mod:`app.modules.compliance_docs` so the same ``verify_project_access`` guard
  applies and cross-project reads surface as 404.
- ``holder_user_id`` is an optional link to a platform user; ``holder_name`` is
  always present so a credential can belong to a named engineer or firm who is
  not (yet) a user of the system.
- ``status`` is derived from the validity window on every write and stored (not
  computed) so ``status='expiring_soon'`` list filters hit an index. Manual
  ``suspended`` / ``revoked`` states are preserved and never auto-flip back.
- Open-ended ``String`` code fields (never DB enums) so a pack can introduce a
  new credential type without a migration.
