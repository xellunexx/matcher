"""International, locale-safe helpers for the Inspections module.

This file is deliberately pure and dependency-free (standard library only).
It holds the maths and plain-language wording that quality and site inspections
need to be clear and correct for construction teams anywhere in the world:

* No hardcoded locale. Dates are formatted as ISO 8601. The overdue check for a
  re-inspection takes an explicit reference date and an explicit SLA window, so
  there is no hidden "server today" or "local timezone" assumption.
* Rates are ratios, never money. ``pass_rate`` returns a value in ``[0.0, 1.0]``
  (or ``[0.0, 100.0]`` as a percentage), never a currency amount and never
  ``NaN`` or ``inf``. ``defect_density`` returns a non-negative count per
  inspection, guarded against division by zero.
* Every derived number exposes its components (passed, evaluated, total, and so
  on) so the result can be explained in the UI rather than trusted blindly.
* Status and result words are translated for English, German and Russian with a
  safe fall-back to the raw code, so a missing translation never crashes and
  never shows a blank.

Nothing here touches the database or the network, which is why the whole file
is exercised by fast, DB-free unit tests. It only adds new helpers; it does not
change any existing service, schema or route signature.
