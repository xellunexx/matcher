"""Field Time event definitions and publishers.

An approved field timesheet is the authoritative record of actual labour and
plant hours for a project-day. When a timesheet is submitted, approved or
reversed this module publishes a single, self-contained event so downstream
consumers can react without re-opening the timesheet inside a foreign session:

* the **payroll** module treats approved timesheets as the preferred source of
  field labour hours (see ``payroll.service``);
* the **cost / EVM** model can roll ``hours x rate`` into labour and plant
  actuals against the budget.

This module owns the canonical event names and typed publishers so every caller
emits an identically shaped payload. The payload carries the hours / cost rollup
inline. Publishing is detached (fire-and-forget) so the request can commit and
release its writer lock before subscribers open a second session - identical
rationale to ``fieldreports/events.py``.

Auto-imported by the module loader when ``oe_field_time`` loads.
