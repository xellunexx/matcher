"""Pure, lossless schedule interchange model (T1.1).

A neutral, versioned document that captures a whole schedule - its header, every
activity (all columns) and the canonical dependency network - so a schedule can
be exported, moved between projects and re-imported with no loss of structure or
logic. The format is independent of internal database ids: every activity is
addressed by a stable string ``ref`` and the parent / relationship endpoints
point at those refs, so the document round-trips into a fresh schedule whose
activities get brand-new ids.

This module is deliberately dependency-free (stdlib only). It never imports the
ORM or ``app.database``, so it imports and unit-tests on the local Python 3.11
runner. The ORM-facing read/write lives in ``interchange_service``; the
DCMA-style normalise-on-import repair lives in the pure ``schedule_clean``.

Two halves:

* :func:`build_export_document` turns live rows (duck-typed - it only uses
  ``getattr`` / ``str``, so ORM rows and plain test doubles both work) into the
  canonical document dict, with money / quantity columns serialised as strings
  to avoid float drift.
* :func:`parse_document` validates and splits an incoming document into a
  :class:`ParsedDocument`; :meth:`ParsedDocument.to_dict` re-emits it. Unknown
  top-level keys survive on :attr:`ParsedDocument.extra` and unknown per-row keys
  survive because rows are carried as whole dicts - so a document written by a
  newer minor version round-trips through an older parser without dropping data.
