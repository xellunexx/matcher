"""Adapters between schedule data and the pure diff-engine envelope.

:mod:`app.modules.schedule.diff_engine` compares two *normalized envelopes*
(plain dicts) and is deliberately ignorant of the ORM and of how baselines are
stored. This module is the thin, pure glue that builds such an envelope from a
live schedule's rows (:func:`live_envelope`) and that coerces an arbitrary,
client-captured ``ScheduleBaseline.snapshot_data`` blob into the same canonical
shape (:func:`normalize_envelope`).

Kept free of FastAPI / SQLAlchemy imports - it only reads attributes off
row-like objects and keys off plain dicts - so it imports under plain CPython
and is unit-testable without the app / DB. JSON-unsafe scalars (UUID, Decimal)
are stringified; the diff engine re-parses them with its tolerant coercers.
