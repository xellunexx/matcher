"""Real-time collaboration service (T3.4).

Optimistic-concurrency guarded writes on a single schedule activity. A client
edits against the revision it last read; this service asks the pure
:mod:`app.modules.schedule.realtime_math` engine whether that base is current,
stale, ahead, or unchanged, and only persists on an APPLY verdict (bumping the
monotonic ``Activity.revision`` token in the same write). A stale base is
rejected so a slow tab can never silently clobber a concurrent edit; an
unchanged double-submit is an idempotent no-op that does not bump the revision.

Wraps :class:`~app.modules.schedule.service.ScheduleService` to reuse the
canonical activity repository and the existing event publishing, so the
``schedule.activity.updated`` event fires unchanged and the presence bridge
picks it up. All writes ``flush`` only; the request middleware owns the commit
(matching every other schedule service).

# A guarded update is a generic ``{field: value}`` patch coming straight from a
# client, so the set of columns it may write MUST be an explicit allowlist - an
# attacker (or a buggy client) must never be able to set ``revision`` (which
# would defeat the lost-update guard), re-parent the activity, move it to
# another schedule, or overwrite immutable bookkeeping. Only plain, obviously
# user-editable scalar columns are listed here. Structural columns
# (``id`` / ``schedule_id`` / ``parent_id`` / ``revision`` / ``created_at`` /
# ``updated_at``), the CPM result columns, the JSON collections (dependencies /
# resources / boq_position_ids / bim_element_ids / metadata) and the cost /
# units / progress-rigor columns are deliberately excluded: those have their
# own validated endpoints (typed-progress, calendar, link-position, ...). Keep
# this list conservative; widen it only with a matching validation story.
