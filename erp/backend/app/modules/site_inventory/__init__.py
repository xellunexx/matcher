"""Site-inventory module (on-site material metering and stock).

Tracks materials from the moment they arrive on site (a procurement goods
receipt) through installation against a BoQ position, waste and shrinkage, and
transfers between storage locations. Stock on hand is never stored: it is derived
as the signed sum of movements by the pure ledger in
:mod:`app.modules.site_inventory.ledger`, which also computes inventory turnover
and days on hand, the waste ratio, and material-cost variance against the
estimate.
