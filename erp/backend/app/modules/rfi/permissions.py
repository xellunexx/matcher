    """Register permissions for the RFI module.

    R5 / BUG-RFI-ROLE: split the previously-monolithic ``rfi.update`` into
    three orthogonal verbs so the FSM gates can be enforced at the router
    layer without the service having to re-derive role from the JWT:

    * ``rfi.assign``  - MANAGER+: only managers / admins may pick or
      change the assignee. Editors can still author RFIs and update body
      fields but cannot redirect ball-in-court to other users.
    * ``rfi.respond`` - EDITOR: anyone with write access may *attempt*
      to respond, but the service still verifies the caller is the
      assignee (or an admin/manager escalation). The permission is the
      coarse gate; the identity check is the fine-grained one.
    * ``rfi.close``   - MANAGER+: closing is a terminal state, restricted
      to managers/admins so a junior estimator can't accidentally close
      an RFI that's still being negotiated.
