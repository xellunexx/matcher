"""Pure interference risk matrix - correlate open clashes with the schedule.

A static clash report tells a coordinator *what* collides. It never tells
them *when* the two colliding trades are actually booked to be on site at
the same time while the clash is still open. That is the moment a paper
clash turns into a field interference: two crews arrive, the beam is still
through the duct, and someone stops work.

This module is the testable core of that correlation. It is deliberately
free of any database, ORM or I/O so it can be unit-tested with plain
values. The owning service (``clash.service``) is responsible for
resolving each clash to its affected BOQ positions, mapping those
positions to schedule activities and reading the planned date windows,
then handing this function a list of :class:`ClashScheduleFacts`.

For each open clash the function answers:

* do the two trades' planned work windows overlap in time,
* how many days of overlap (or, when disjoint, the gap between them),
* how soon the shared window starts relative to a reference ``today``,
* a risk score combining severity x cost impact x window proximity,
* a status: ``imminent`` / ``upcoming`` / ``no-overlap`` /
  ``no-schedule-data``.

Money stays in :class:`~decimal.Decimal` the whole way through; the cost
impact is echoed back byte-exact and the risk score is computed with
Decimal arithmetic so the ranking never picks up binary-float drift.

# ── Vocabulary ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: Clash lifecycle states that still carry an interference risk, across BOTH
#: clash vocabularies: the per-row ``ClashResult`` open set
#: (``new``/``active``/``reviewed``, named ``OPEN_STATUSES`` in
#: ``clash.schemas``) and the smart-issue lifecycle open set
#: (``new``/``persisted``, drawn from ``CLASH_ISSUE_STATUSES``). A resolved,
#: approved, ignored or archived clash no longer warns anyone either way.
#:
#: Deliberately a union rather than a copy of either one, because this module
#: is pure and DB-free: it is handed :class:`ClashScheduleFacts` and cannot
#: tell which table the ``status`` on them came from. The name says
#: ``RESULT_OR_ISSUE`` rather than plain ``OPEN_STATUSES`` precisely so it
#: cannot be mistaken for ``clash.schemas.OPEN_STATUSES``, which is the
#: narrower ``ClashResult``-only set and the right thing to filter a
#: ``ClashResult`` query by. Passed as a default so callers may narrow it.
