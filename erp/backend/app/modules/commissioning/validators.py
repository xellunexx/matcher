"""Pure, database-free commissioning validation and readiness math.

This module is deliberately side-effect free so it can be unit tested without a
database and reused from the service, a report generator or a test. It answers
two questions about a commissionable system:

1. **How ready is it?** ``compute_readiness`` turns the status of a system's
   *functional* checklist items (plus its open critical issue count) into an
   explainable readiness figure - the percent of applicable functional items
   that have passed - with every component it was derived from exposed so a
   reader can reproduce the number by hand.
2. **May it be commissioned?** The same call decides ``can_commission`` and
   lists the human-readable ``blocking_reasons`` when it may not. The gate is:
   no open functional checklist item (every functional item is ``pass`` or
   ``na``) and no open ``critical`` issue, with at least one applicable
   functional item to pass.

Items marked ``na`` (not applicable) are excluded from the denominator, matching
standard commissioning practice: readiness is measured over the tests that
actually apply to the system.

    """Return an explainable commissioning-readiness breakdown.

    Args:
        functional_item_statuses: The ``status`` of every *functional*
            checklist item on the system (any casing). Unrecognised values are
            treated conservatively as ``pending`` so a malformed status never
            counts as passed.
        open_critical_issues: Count of ``critical`` issues on the system that
            are still ``open``. Negative or non-integer input is coerced to 0.

    Returns:
        A dictionary exposing the derived figure and every component it was
        built from::

        The result never contains ``NaN`` or infinity: with no applicable items
        the percent is a well-defined ``0.0`` flagged ``defined=False`` so a
        caller can render "no data" rather than a misleading zero.
