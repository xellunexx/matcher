"""Forecast service for Project Intelligence (TOP-30 #19).

Assembles the predictive cost + schedule + risk analytics for a project by
reading from already-committed sibling modules **read-only**:

* ``finance.EVMSnapshot`` (the latest EVM snapshot: BAC / EV / AC / PV) - the
  same source ``full_evm.EVMService.calculate_forecast`` reads. We recompute
  the canonical Earned-Value formulas live (no row is written) via the pure
  helpers in :mod:`forecast`.
* ``schedule`` activities + the schedule baseline finish - for the schedule
  slip projection.
* ``risk`` register - open high-severity unmitigated risks feed the risk score.

The service owns no models and writes nothing. It uses raw SQL through the
request session (the same decoupled pattern :mod:`collector` uses) so it does
not import or perturb the sibling services. Every read is wrapped so a missing
or renamed sibling table degrades to "unavailable" rather than failing the
whole forecast.
