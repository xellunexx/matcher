"""Offline raster candidate detection for PDF takeoff (issue #194).

This is the raster twin of :mod:`app.modules.takeoff.recognize`. The vector
recognizer reads a page's drawing layer (``page.get_drawings()``); on a SCANNED
plan that layer is empty, so it correctly returns nothing. This module instead
looks at the rendered raster image of the page with OpenCV and proposes the same
candidate shape:

* large light regions sealed by dark walls -> ``area`` candidates (rooms),
* long straight wall edges -> ``distance`` (length) candidates,
* (count detection is intentionally omitted on scans, see below).

The detection runs in IMAGE PIXEL space but every candidate is returned in PDF
POINT space, the same coordinate space the canvas stores measurements in, so the
shapes drop straight onto the viewer with no further transform. The mapping is a
simple per-axis scale from the rendered pixmap size to the page size in points.

Raster detection is inherently less certain than reading clean vector geometry,
so confidences here are deliberately lower than the vector path (rooms ~0.45 to
0.60, walls ~0.40 to 0.50). Every candidate carries an honest ``reason`` ending
in "(verify)" so the user confirms, edits or rejects it (CLAUDE.md rule 7:
AI-augmented, human-confirmed).

Count detection is skipped on purpose: repeated symbols (doors, fixtures) on a
low-contrast scan cluster unreliably and tend to produce noise, and the brief
for this module is to return a handful of good rooms rather than many shaky
boxes. The vector recognizer still handles counts when a drawing layer exists.

The module is pure (no DB, no FastAPI). ``cv2`` and ``numpy`` are base
dependencies, so this detector runs in every default install; only the OCR
engine sits behind the optional ``cv`` extra. They are imported at module top
on purpose: the *caller* imports this module lazily and catches
``ImportError``, so a broken OpenCV wheel degrades to an empty candidate set
instead of taking the whole takeoff service down at import time. Every risky
OpenCV call is wrapped so a degenerate image yields ``[]`` rather than raising.
