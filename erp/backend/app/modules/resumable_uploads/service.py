"""Resumable Uploads business logic.

The service owns the session lifecycle: create, accept-chunk (idempotent),
report status, complete (assemble + integrity + hand-off to the document
store), abort, and a GC sweep for stale sessions. All chunk math lives in
:mod:`app.modules.resumable_uploads.chunking` so it can be unit-tested
without a DB; this layer wires that math to the ORM and the filesystem.
