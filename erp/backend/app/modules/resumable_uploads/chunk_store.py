"""Filesystem chunk store for resumable uploads.

Chunks for an in-flight session land under a per-session temp directory.
Assembly streams the parts in index order into a single temp file and
computes the SHA-256 incrementally, so the whole payload is never held in
memory. The assembled file is then handed to the document service.

The temp root sits under the same per-user data directory the rest of the
local storage uses (``OE_CLI_DATA_DIR`` / ``DATA_DIR`` / ``~/.openestimator``)
so it inherits the platform's safe-root containment and is cleaned up by
the GC sweep.
