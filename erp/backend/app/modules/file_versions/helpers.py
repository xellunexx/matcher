"""Helpers for wiring upload paths into the version-chain service.

Epic C - Document Versioning Unification (deep coordination)
============================================================

The version-chain key is ``(project_id, file_kind, canonical_name)``.
Each kind has its own "name" attribute on its ORM row (``Document.name``,
``ProjectPhoto.filename``, ``Sheet.sheet_number``, ``BIMModel.name`` …)
and a single helper here keeps the upload paths consistent so a
re-upload always lands in the same chain.

Rules
-----
* Whitespace is stripped (matches ``FileVersionService._canonicalize``).
* Case is preserved so ``Plan.pdf`` and ``PLAN.PDF`` form distinct chains
  - the file manager renders both literally and a forced-lowercase rule
  would silently merge them.
* Sheets without a ``sheet_number`` fall back to a deterministic
  composite (``page-NN of source.pdf``) so a multi-page split still
  produces N stable chain keys.
* Photos use ``filename``; BIM models use ``name``; documents use
  ``name``.

The helper accepts either an ORM object (preferred - the upload path
just hands its freshly-created row over) or a raw ``str``. The raw
form is useful in tests and in the CDE cross-link path where only the
filename is known.

    """Return the chain-key ``canonical_name`` for a file-kind row.

    Args:
        file_kind: One of ``document``, ``photo``, ``sheet``, ``bim_model``,
            ``dwg_drawing``, ``takeoff``, ``report``, ``markup``.
        entity: Either the freshly-created ORM row for that kind, OR a
            raw filename string. The raw-string fallback exists so the
            upload paths can pre-compute the chain key before the row
            exists (rare) and so the CDE / transmittal cross-links can
            re-derive it from a filename.

    Returns:
        Canonical name (whitespace-stripped, case-preserving). Never
        empty - falls back to ``"untitled"`` so the chain key always
        has a non-trivial value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When ``file_kind`` is not a recognised kind. The
            upload paths already pass a constant so this is mostly a
            guard against typos at call sites.
