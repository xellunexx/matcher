"""Voice-capture API routes (mounted at /api/v1/voice).

Endpoints:
    GET  /targets   - list the supported target types (diary_note, defect, task)
    POST /draft     - turn a recording OR a transcript + a target type into a
                      structured DRAFT the user reviews and confirms

The module is stateless - it never writes a row. The draft it returns is saved
(only after human review) through the target feature's own create endpoint, so
the "AI suggests, human confirms" boundary lives in the target UI. Authorization
is project-scoped: ``/draft`` runs verify_project_access against the project the
draft is for before doing any work, matching the phone-log and value modules.
