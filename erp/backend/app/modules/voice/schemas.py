"""Voice-capture Pydantic schemas - request/response models (Pydantic v2).

The voice module is stateless: it turns a recording (or a transcript) plus a
target type into a structured DRAFT the caller reviews and then saves through the
target feature's own create endpoint. Nothing here is persisted, so there is only
a response model (plus a light transcription-info block) - no create/update
schema and no ORM model.
