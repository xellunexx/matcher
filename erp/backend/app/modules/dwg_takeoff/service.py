# The question this has to answer is "did the process that owned this

# real defect: a detached asyncio task never survives a restart, so after a
# crash or reinstall nothing will ever complete or fail the row and the page
# polls "processing" forever - the "Converting... 2547m" spinner a real user
# hit.
#
# This used to be approximated with elapsed time, and the approximation was
# wrong in the expensive direction. It condemned conversions that were running
# perfectly well, and then told the user to delete the drawing, which is the
# one operation that was blocked at the time. Elapsed time cannot separate the
# two cases, because the work has no upper bound to compare against: the DDC
# subprocess is capped at OE_DWG_CONVERT_TIMEOUT_S, but the xlsx parse that
# follows it has no timeout at all and its cost tracks the size of the
# drawing. Measured on a 200,000 row export, that parse alone took 86 seconds.
# A 22 MB drawing can therefore cross any cutoff derived from the converter's
# budget while doing exactly what it should.
#
# So the task now reports that it is alive, and this reads that report. The
# cutoff stops being a guess about how long a customer's drawing takes and
# becomes a fact about how often we write, which is the one number we control.

        lives only as a ``Document`` row and has no ``DwgDrawing`` to

          points at the same blob on disk, the existing one is returned

          validation as the direct upload path, copies the blob into the
          DWG upload dir, creates the drawing row, and dispatches
          processing (DXF inline → ``ready``; DWG fire-and-forget).
        * Raises 404 when the document or its file is missing, 400 when
          it is not a ``.dwg`` / ``.dxf`` file.

        The owning project's access has already been gated by the router

        Pre-conversion stability guards (Indian-user ticket 2026-05-13):

        1. ``_sniff_dwg_version`` checks the 6-byte ``AC####`` magic
           prefix. Renamed PDFs/ZIPs and truncated files are rejected
           here with a clean 422 instead of being handed to the
           converter (which spends 90+ s on them and then returns a
           confusing "empty output" error).

        2. ``_dwg_version_too_old`` rejects DWGs older than the
           2010 (R18) format. DDC's DwgExporter occasionally produces silent
           empty output for R14/R15/R16/R17 files; the upgrade hint
           is a much better UX than "no entities found".

        answer so it never spins forever (the fresh-install bug: demo DWG
        rows are seeded ``status="uploaded"`` and, with no DDC DwgExporter
        on disk, nothing ever transitions them).

        Resolution:

        * If parsed entities already exist -> ``ready`` (open it FAST,
          regardless of the stored lifecycle status).
        * A genuine terminal status (``ready`` / ``empty`` / ``error``) is
          passed through untouched.
        * A ``.dxf`` row still sitting at ``uploaded`` parses out of the
          box via ezdxf, so ``processing`` is the honest "give me a moment"
          state (the inline parse normally finishes before the first poll).
        * A ``.dwg`` row at ``uploaded`` with no entities and no available
          converter is reported as ``needs_conversion`` - a clear, friendly,
          actionable state ("Convert with cad2data") instead of a perpetual
          spinner. If the converter IS present the row is genuinely mid-flight,
          so we keep ``processing``.

        ``converter_present`` lets a batch caller (the list endpoint) probe the
        converter once and pass it in, avoiding a per-row filesystem probe.
