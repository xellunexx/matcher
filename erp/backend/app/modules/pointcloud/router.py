# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Point Cloud / Reality Capture API routes.

Mounted by the module loader at ``/api/v1/pointcloud/``. All routes are
RBAC-gated; the service layer additionally closes cross-tenant IDOR holes by
404-ing project-mismatched accesses.

Phase 0 wires the read surface (list scans by project, get one scan) and the
presigned-direct-to-MinIO multipart ingest surface (init + complete). The bytes
go straight to object storage; the FastAPI core only mints the key, hands back
presigned part URLs and finalises the multipart upload. The converter wiring and
measurement surface land in later phases.
