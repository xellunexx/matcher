"""International, explainable helpers for submittal review analytics.

This module is deliberately pure and dependency-free (standard library
only). It holds no database, no FastAPI, and no framework state, so it can
be imported and unit-tested in isolation. It is strictly additive: nothing
here changes the existing service, schema, or router contracts. It layers
plain-language, locale-aware reporting on top of the vocabulary those files
already define.

Design goals:

* International. Dates are ISO 8601 (``YYYY-MM-DD``). No locale is baked
  into any calculation. Review outcome and status words are translatable
  (en / de / ru today) with a safe English fallback. The review SLA is
  always a caller-supplied parameter, never a hidden constant.
* Clarity. Every figure has a one-line, plain-language explainer a site
  engineer or estimator can read in seconds.
* Robust edge cases. Division by zero, empty inputs, negative counts, and
  a review dated before its submission all return well-defined values or
  raise a clean ``ValueError``. No figure is ever NaN, infinity, or a
  misleading negative.
* Explainability. Every derived figure documents how it is computed and
  exposes its raw components so a reviewer can audit the number.

The status and outcome vocabularies mirror the ones pinned by
``schemas.py`` (``SubmittalReviewRequest``) and ``service.py``
(``_SUBMITTAL_STATUS_TRANSITIONS``). They are restated here as plain data
so this module stays import-light and independent; keep them in sync if the
canonical vocabulary ever grows.
