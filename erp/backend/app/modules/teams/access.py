"""Reusable project-membership and record-restriction access helpers.

Every module that needs to gate access behind team membership (projects,
BOQ, HSE, Carbon, Variations, …) should route through these helpers rather
than inlining a fresh copy of the TeamMembership query.

Project-level membership:

* :func:`is_project_member` - async boolean check used in route guards.
* :func:`member_project_ids_subquery` - synchronous scalar subquery used
  in ORM ``WHERE … IN (…)`` clauses for list/aggregate endpoints.

Record-level restriction:

* :func:`hidden_entity_ids` - the subset of ids the caller must NOT see.
* :func:`assert_entity_not_hidden` - the same answer as a 404.
* :func:`hidden_entity_ids_subquery` - the SQL form for a list endpoint.

Why the restriction helpers are subtractive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
They answer "which of the ids you already decided this user may see must now
be taken away", never "which ids may this user see". The signature is what
enforces the invariant: a consumer physically cannot use them to add an id to
a result set, so no arrangement of teams and restrictions can hand anyone
visibility of a project or a record they could not already reach. The team
layer is only ever allowed to narrow.

The correct call order in a consumer is therefore always:

    1. establish project access (``verify_project_access`` - 404 on denial),
    2. build the result set the caller is entitled to,
    3. subtract :func:`hidden_entity_ids` from it.

Skipping step 1 and relying on step 3 would be an access-control bug: an
unrestricted record is hidden from nobody, which is correct behaviour for a
narrowing filter and useless as a gate.

Failure policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These helpers fail CLOSED. If the restriction lookup raises - a dropped
connection, a malformed id - every candidate id is reported as hidden. An
access-control resolver that cannot reach its data must not answer "nothing is
restricted", which is what a fail-open default would say. That mirrors
:func:`is_project_member`, which answers "not a member" when its query fails.

    Subtract the result from a set the caller has ALREADY established the user

    An id is hidden when a restriction row exists for it inside *project_id*
    and the user belongs to none of the teams those rows name. An id with no
    restriction row is never hidden, which is what keeps the feature opt-in
    per record.

    The project owner and system admins are never locked out of their own
    project: a restriction is a "who else may look at this" control, not a way
    to hide a record from the people accountable for it. Callers pass those two
    flags because they have already resolved them while checking project access.

        session: Async session.
        project_id: The project the records belong to. Restriction rows written
            against teams of any other project are ignored, so a row cannot
            reach across a project boundary.
        entity_type: A key from :mod:`app.modules.teams.entity_types`.
        entity_ids: The candidate ids, as the strings they are stored under.
        user_id: The caller. ``None`` (a system/background call) hides nothing.
