"""Cost-match ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_cost_match_run       - one batch of pasted descriptions matched at once
    oe_cost_match_result    - one source line and the suggestion it received
    oe_cost_match_decision  - one human ruling on one result (append-only)

Why a run is persisted at all
-----------------------------
A quantity surveyor pastes a few hundred free-text lines from a foreign
subcontractor's bill and needs the answer to survive the browser tab: which
lines were matched, how confidently, on what evidence, and who accepted each
one. The three tables above are that record.

The suggestion is a snapshot, not a pointer
-------------------------------------------
``suggested_cost_item_id`` (and ``decided_cost_item_id`` on the decision) are
bare indexed UUID columns with **no** foreign key to ``oe_costs_item``, and the
code, description, unit, rate and currency of the matched item are copied onto
the row. Two reasons, both load-bearing:

* Cost bases are reloaded. A regional base is re-imported and rows are
  re-keyed; a FK would either block the import or cascade the review history
  away with it. The same reasoning is on ``FormworkAssignment.boq_position_id``.
* A confirmed match has to stay auditable against the rate that was **shown**
  at confirm time, not against today's rate. Reconstructing it by following a
  pointer would silently re-price history.

Money
-----
``suggested_rate`` / ``decided_rate`` are ``Numeric(18, 4)`` and nullable.
``CostItem.rate`` is a Decimal-as-string column, so an unparseable or absent
value lands here as ``NULL``, which is precisely the signal the
``cost_match.rate_present`` validation rule reads. They serialise as strings
through :mod:`app.modules.cost_match.schemas`.

Relationship loading is declared explicitly on every ``relationship()`` per
``.claude/rules/backend-modules.md``. ``MatchRun.results`` is the case that
rules file names by hand: a run holds hundreds of results and every screen
pages through them, so it is ``raise_on_sql`` and the repository does the
paging. A result's decision history is small, always read with the result and
is the point of the review UI, so it is ``selectin``. Every back-reference is
``raise_on_sql``.
