"""Cost-match module-specific validation rules.

Matching a foreign bill onto a cost base is fast, which is exactly why it is
dangerous: a few hundred rates are adopted in an afternoon and nothing on the
screen distinguishes a good match from a plausible-looking wrong one. These
rules make the specific ways that goes wrong checkable.

They register under the ``cost_match`` rule set and self-select by the
``scope`` carried on the validated data, so one set serves two passes:

Result scope (``scope == "result"``, one line and its ruling):

* ``cost_match.source_description_present`` - ERROR. A blank pasted line
  cannot be matched to anything, and confirming one adopts a rate for scope
  nobody described.
* ``cost_match.unit_dimension_matches``     - ERROR. The chosen item is priced
  in a different physical dimension from the line (an area rate bought against
  a volume). This is the single most expensive mistake in the whole workflow.
* ``cost_match.rate_present``               - ERROR. The chosen item carries no
  usable unit rate, so the line prices at nothing.
* ``cost_match.decision_has_reviewer``      - ERROR. A ruling with no person
  attached is an auto-applied suggestion, which the platform does not permit.
* ``cost_match.confidence_above_floor``     - WARNING. A suggestion accepted as
  it stands although the matcher scored it below its own review floor.
* ``cost_match.tie_resolved_by_reviewer``   - WARNING. Two candidates scored
  identically and the winner was picked by input order, then confirmed. That
  is not a judgement, it is an accident.
* ``cost_match.source_unit_present``        - WARNING. No unit on the line, so
  the dimension check that guards against area-versus-volume could not run.
* ``cost_match.quantity_present``           - INFO. No quantity, so the line
  carries a rate but can never carry a total.

Run scope (``scope == "run"``, the whole batch):

* ``cost_match.currency_consistent``        - ERROR. Accepted matches priced in
  more than one currency cannot be summed into a bill.
* ``cost_match.duplicate_lines_agree``      - WARNING. The same description
  appears twice and was ruled onto two different cost items, so identical
  scope is priced two ways.
* ``cost_match.review_queue_cleared``       - WARNING. Results still awaiting a
  person. The run is not a priced result yet.

The rules are pure and database-free: :mod:`app.modules.cost_match.service`
builds the plain-dict payloads and calls :func:`evaluate_result` /
:func:`evaluate_run`. Money and quantities arrive as decimal strings and stay
decimal - no float appears here. Unit comparison is delegated to the matcher's
:func:`~app.modules.cost_match.matcher.units_compatible`, so the rule and the
score agree on what "compatible" means instead of each having an opinion.
