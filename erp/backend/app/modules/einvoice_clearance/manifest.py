        "Romania, Saudi Arabia and India clear the document with the tax "
        "authority before or as it is issued, Spain and Hungary report it "
        "afterwards, and the European public sector exchanges it over a "
        "network. This module holds the registration per country, the state of "
        "each document, the identifier the authority returned and the trail "
        "behind it. The document itself is built by the EN 16931 engine; the "
        "platforms are adapters behind an interface."
