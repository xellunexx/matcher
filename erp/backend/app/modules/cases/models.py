"""Cases ORM models.

Tables:
    oe_cases_user_case - a case scenario written by a user
    oe_cases_pin       - a case pinned to a project, per user

``UserCase.steps`` is a JSON array rather than a child table. The steps of a
case are always read and rewritten as a whole: the editor saves the ordered
list in one go, the reader walks it start to finish, and nothing ever queries a
single step across cases. A child table would buy a relationship every caller
has to eager-load and an ordinal column to keep in sync, and buy nothing back.
The shape is validated by the Pydantic layer before it is stored, so the column
is not a free-form bag - see :mod:`app.modules.cases.schemas`.

Nothing here is ever queried *inside* the JSON. That matters: on PostgreSQL a
``.contains()`` on a plain JSON column compiles to a string LIKE, not to JSONB
containment, so a filter written that way would silently mean something else.
Filtering is done on real columns only.

    works, which is the version a new starter needs.
