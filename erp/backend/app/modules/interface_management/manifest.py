        "Coordination register for the interfaces (handshakes) between work "
        "packages, contractors and disciplines on a project - the standard tool "

        "OWNS it, who ACCEPTS or depends on it, the date it must be agreed by, "
        "its type (physical, functional, contractual, spatial, information, "
        "schedule) and its status (identified, open, in progress, agreed, closed, "
        "disputed, on hold), alongside the actions needed to close it. The module "
        "derives the per-status, per-priority and per-type counts, the overdue "
        "and disputed lists, the agreed percentage, the open action load, a "
        "per-work-package health view and a single overall health score, so a "
        "coordinator can see at a glance where the coordination risk sits."
