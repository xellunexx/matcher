"""Plan Room module.

A read-only overlay compositor for a document page: it merges the page's
punch-list defect pins, drawing markups, takeoff measurements and site photos
into a single payload for the viewer, and owns a small table of positioned
photo / note pins dropped directly on the sheet.

Every external overlay source (punchlist, markups, takeoff, photos) is read at
request time behind a fail-soft lazy import, so an absent or disabled module
simply contributes an empty list rather than breaking the read.
