"""Pure markup-cascade engine for the estimating-methodology module.

This is the deterministic math core that the whole methodology feature depends
on. It computes an ordered markup cascade where each step applies to an
EXPLICIT set of prior amounts (a leaf base, a named composite, or an earlier
step), unlike the existing binary direct_cost/cumulative markup model.

Design constraints (intentional, see internal design note ESTIMATE_METHODOLOGIES_PLAN
section 5):

* Standard library only - ``decimal``, ``dataclasses``, ``typing``. No imports
  from ``app.*`` and no third-party packages, so this single file can be loaded
  and unit-tested standalone via ``importlib`` on Python 3.11 (the local
  interpreter), while the rest of the backend requires Python 3.12.
* No PEP 695 ``type X = ...`` aliases (3.12+ only). ``from __future__ import
  annotations`` keeps every annotation a string so nothing is evaluated at
  import time.
* All money is :class:`decimal.Decimal`; never ``float``. Each step result is
  quantized to ``decimals`` places with ``ROUND_HALF_UP`` IMMEDIATELY, and
  later steps that reference an earlier step consume its already-rounded amount
  (round-per-step, feed-forward).

    OWNERSHIP. This is the reusable estimating methodology of a company or a
    project. It is NOT the markup stack of a bill. A bill's markup lines are
    :class:`~app.modules.boq.models.BOQMarkup` rows and their amounts come from
    :func:`app.modules.boq.service._calculate_markup_amounts`, which is
    authoritative for anything a bill puts its name to. The bridge runs one
    way: a methodology may seed a bill's markup lines. Nothing here is summed
    into a bill's total. Two engines with stated, different jobs is the
    intended arrangement; two engines with the same job is what it avoids.

    ROUNDING. Every step here is quantized immediately (see the module
    docstring) and later steps consume the rounded amount. The bill's cascade
    keeps full precision to the rollup and quantizes once. On the same inputs
    the two differ by cents, deliberately. They are not reconciled, because
    changing either moves the total of estimates already stored in customer
    databases, which is its own decision with its own migration.
