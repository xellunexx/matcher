"""Pure CDE go-live readiness checklist + readiness score.

Standing up a common data environment is not "switch it on"; ISO 19650 asks a
team to agree a handful of things up front and then actually exercise the
workflow before the CDE can be trusted as the single source of truth. Teams that
skip that end up with a shared folder wearing a CDE badge: containers all stuck
in WIP, no suitability discipline, no signed approvals, no version history. This
engine answers one concrete question for a single project - given what the
project has ACTUALLY done in its CDE, how ready is it to go live, and what are
the next few things to fix?

The model is a transparent, ordered checklist, not a black box. There is a
built-in catalogue of readiness signals (:data:`READINESS_SIGNALS`), each naming
a milestone on the "stand up a CDE properly" path: containers exist, structured
naming is in use, suitability codes are assigned, work has moved out of WIP into
the shared area, at least one container has been approved into the published
state, gate crossings carry a sign-off, and revisions are being versioned. The
integrator observes the project's real container/transition state, projects it
onto the SET of signal keys that are satisfied, and this engine reports which
signals are met, a weighted readiness score, a coarse readiness level, and the
leading unmet signals as a "do these next" nudge.

Honesty rules, same spirit as :mod:`app.modules.value.adoption_checklist`:

* A signal is met only when the integrator observed its key; an unrecognised key
  matches nothing, so readiness is never invented.
* The score is a weighted percent of met signals out of ALL catalogue signals -
  readiness is measured against the whole go-live path, so a project cannot look
  "ready" by doing only the two cheapest steps.
* Weights lean towards the milestones that actually prove the workflow runs
  (a container reaching the published state, a signed gate crossing) rather than
  metadata hygiene, without letting any single signal dominate.

No database, no ORM, no ``app.*`` imports - stdlib only, so this runs on the
local Python 3.11 test runner exactly like the other pure engines. The thin
service layer (written separately) reads the CDE tables, derives the observed
signal keys, and calls in here. Nothing here is money, so there is no Decimal
arithmetic; the only number produced is an integer percent in ``[0, 100]``.
