"""ISO 19650 functional roles for the Common Data Environment.

Information management under ISO 19650 is organised around a small set of
functional roles that a project fixes once and reuses across every discipline:
Author, Reviewer, Approver and Viewer. They are *responsibilities* in the
document workflow, not job titles - one person can be an Author on their own
discipline and a Viewer on someone else's.

Each functional role maps onto the CDE state machine (see
``app.core.cde_states``): the Reviewer owns Gate A (WIP -> SHARED), the Approver
owns Gate B (SHARED -> PUBLISHED), the Author produces content in WIP, and the
Viewer consumes shared and published information. Keeping the mapping declarative
here (rather than scattered through the UI) means the responsibility model is one
source of truth, surfaced through ``GET /v1/cde/functional-roles``.

Reference: ISO 19650-2:2018 - information management roles and responsibilities.
Labels here are English defaults; the frontend runs them through i18n keyed by the
role key (``cde.role_<key>_*``).

# presets a CDE can adopt (see ``approval_routes.seed.PRESETS`` for the actual
# route + step definitions - this module only adds the CDE-facing framing:
# which gate the preset gates and why a team would pick it). Kept here rather
# than in approval_routes so that module stays generic and CDE-agnostic; the
# ``system_key`` is the join key between the two. Order matches the workflow
# (lightest review first).
