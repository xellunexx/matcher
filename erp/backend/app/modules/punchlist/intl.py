"""International, locale-safe helpers for the Punch List module.

This file is deliberately pure and dependency-free (standard library only).
It holds the maths and plain-language wording that a punch list needs to be
clear and correct for construction teams anywhere in the world:

* No hardcoded locale. Dates are formatted as ISO 8601. The overdue check
  takes an explicit reference date and an explicit grace threshold, so there
  is no hidden "server today" or "local timezone" assumption.
* Rates are ratios, never money. ``completion_rate`` returns a value in
  ``[0.0, 1.0]`` (or ``[0.0, 100.0]`` as a percentage), never a currency
  amount and never ``NaN`` or ``inf``.
* Every derived number exposes its components (closed, open, total) so the
  result can be explained in the UI rather than trusted blindly.
* Status and severity words are translated for English, German and Russian
  with a safe fall-back to the raw code, so a missing translation never
  crashes and never shows a blank.

Nothing here touches the database or the network, which is why the whole
file is exercised by fast, DB-free unit tests.
