"""Demo seed data for the documents photo gallery.

Loaded on demand via ``await seed_photos(session, project_ids)``.

Seeds real construction site photos so a fresh install arrives with a
populated Photos gallery (and a non-empty "Latest site photos" dashboard
widget) instead of an empty grid. The bundled JPEGs live under the
committed asset directory ``scripts/flagship_assets/site_photos`` together
with a ``captions.json`` that carries the caption, category, capture date
and tags for each image. The flagship project receives the full twelve
photo construction timeline; every other project receives a rotating
subset of the more generic build-stage photos (excavation, slab, rebar,
crane) so no project gallery is blank.

Each row is stored exactly like a real upload: the file id is generated up
front, the JPEG is copied into ``PHOTO_BASE / "demo" / {project_id}`` and a
JPEG thumbnail is written under ``PHOTO_THUMB_BASE`` using the same helper
the upload endpoint uses, so the gallery serves the seeded photos from
``GET /v1/documents/photos/{id}/file/`` and ``/thumb/`` without any special
casing.

The seed is idempotent: it short-circuits and returns an empty dict when a
photo already exists for the flagship (or first) project. It never touches
a lazy relationship after a flush, and every non-nullable column receives a
typed value. Projects without a resolvable owner are skipped.
