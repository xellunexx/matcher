"""Smart Views ORM models.

A :class:`SmartView` carries an ordered list of *rules* in a JSON
column - the rules themselves are validated by Pydantic in
``schemas.py``, the DB just persists them as opaque JSON. The
counter-intuitive design choice is that we DO NOT snapshot which
elements are hidden / coloured at save time; the rules re-evaluate
against the live ``BIMElement.properties`` every time the view is
loaded. See ``__init__.py`` for the rationale.

Tables:
    oe_smart_view  - one rule-set scoped to a user, project, or
                     federation. ``id`` / ``created_at`` /
                     ``updated_at`` come from :class:`app.database.Base`.

    * ``project``    - shared inside one project (``scope_id`` =
                       project UUID); visible to anyone with
                       ``bim.read`` on that project.
    * ``federation`` - shared inside one federation (``scope_id`` =
                       federation UUID).

    The ``rules`` JSON column carries the ordered list of rule dicts
    documented by :class:`SmartViewRule` in ``schemas.py``. Later rules
    override earlier ones - semantics validated by the evaluator.
