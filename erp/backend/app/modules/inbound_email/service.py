"""Inbound email service - parse a stored message and flag delay signals.

A thin wrapper over the two pure engines: it parses a raw RFC-822 message into
a normalized record and runs the delay detector over its subject and body. It
imports only the dependency-free engines (no database, no framework), so it is
importable and testable on the local runner; the router adapts an uploaded file
to it.
