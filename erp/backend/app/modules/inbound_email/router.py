"""Inbound email API routes (auto-mounted at /api/v1/inbound-email).

A single endpoint that imports a stored RFC-822 message (a ".eml" file) and
returns the parsed record together with any construction delay signals detected
in it. The intake is a file import, not a live mailbox; nothing is persisted.
