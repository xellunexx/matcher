// #149 - /data-explorer was named several different ways. Three names were on
// the page itself (breadcrumb, header heading, empty-state hero) and more were
// on other pages linking to it, so a user could read "Data Explorer" in the BIM
// explainer, click it, and land on a page headed "CAD-BIM BI Explorer".
//
// WHY THIS FILE CHANGED SHAPE. The first version of this guard listed the keys
// that were known to hold a second name and asserted nothing read them. That
// denylist is why the first census of this defect came back short: a call site
// that mints a NEW key holding the OLD English text is invisible to a list of
// keys, and four such sites (ai.open_explorer, ai.open_data_explorer,
// files.module.data_explorer, howto.data-explorer.title) were missed on the
// first pass and found only when the search moved from keys to destinations.
//
// So the load-bearing assertion is now RETIRED_NAMES, not RETIRED_NAME_KEYS: no
// source file may contain a whole string literal equal to a name this page used
// to go by, whatever key it hangs on. That catches the shapes the label/navigate
// regex structurally cannot see - `route: (_p, f) => withParam('/data-explorer')`
// beside a `label:`, a `['/data-explorer', '...']` tuple, `<P title="...">` on a
// <Route>, and a titleDefault in a help catalogue entry.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT. Prose that mentions the page
// inside a sentence ("...jump out to the Data Explorer or the map...") is the
// same defect in kind but is not a whole string literal, and for the ones that
// matter the rendered English lives in en.ts, which this agent does not own.
// Asserting on substrings would make this guard wider than the artifact and
// permanently red on text nobody here can fix. Those are handed to the locale
// owner instead; see the report. A guard that cannot be satisfied gets weakened,
// and a weakened guard is worse than a narrow one.
//
