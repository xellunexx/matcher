 * Two data families with different number contracts:
 *   - S-curve and cumulative percentages are plain floats (0-100), safe to
 *     render and chart directly.
 *   - Quantity-variance figures are Decimal serialised as STRINGS (never
 *     numbers) to match the BOQ position storage convention. Keep them typed
 *     as ``string`` and format at the edge; only ``parseFloat`` a percentage
 *     for a progress-bar width, never do money/quantity math on them here.

 *
 * ``boq_position_id`` is nullable, and the two cases are genuinely different
 * readings rather than one with a shortcut. A position id records how far one
 * line item has got, and those readings are what the project percentage is
 * rolled up from. Omitting it records an overall reading for the project,
 * which is the fallback the rollup uses only when no line has been measured -
 * so a project-level entry alongside position readings keeps its own row and
 * its entry count but does not move the headline number.
 *
 * ``period_label`` is a free string capped at 20 characters and is the axis
 * everything is grouped by, so it has to be written the same way every time.
 * The dialog defaults it to the current ISO month for exactly that reason.
