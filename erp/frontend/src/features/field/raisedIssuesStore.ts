/**
 * Durable store for issues raised from the field shell.
 *
 * Why a second store rather than the mutation queue: the offline mutation queue
 * (`shared/lib/offline`) is JSON-only - its sender serialises every op body as
 * `application/json` - so it cannot carry a photo, and it has no way to feed the
 * server-assigned punch id of one op into a later op. A field defect therefore
 * splits in two:
 *
 *   1. the punch CREATE goes through the queue (idempotent on `client_op_id`,
 *      replayed with the field-session headers), and
 *   2. the PHOTO is parked here as a durable record keyed by that same
 *      `client_op_id`, then uploaded on the next online sync once the created
 *      punch id is known (from the drain result or the server sync ledger).
 *
 * Keeping the raised-issue log here also lets the tab show recently-raised
 * issues - including ones that already synced - across a reload, which a
 * queue-only view cannot: the queue drops an op the moment it drains.
 *
 * Storage mirrors the mutation queue's approach: IndexedDB in the browser (it
 * stores a `Blob`/`File` natively via structured clone), with an in-memory
 * fallback so private mode, SSR and tests never crash. Every method degrades to
 * a no-op / empty result on a storage error rather than throwing into a capture.
