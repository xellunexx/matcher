/**
 * Pure derivation for "build a viewer selection set from a set of findings".
 *
 * A coordinator picks several clash / validation findings in the review table
 * and wants to see EVERY element those findings reference, framed together in
 * the 3D viewer. This module turns the chosen findings into:
 *
 *   - the de-duplicated union of all referenced element ids (each clash names
 *     two interfering elements, `a_element_id` / `b_element_id`),
 *   - a single world centroid to frame the camera on (the mean of the chosen
 *     findings' own centroids), and
 *   - the target model id, plus a `mixedModels` flag because the viewer
 *     deep-link addresses ONE model: a selection spanning several models can
 *     only isolate the elements that live in the model it opens.
 *
 * Everything here is a *pure function* over already-fetched `ClashResult`
 * rows - no fetch, no React, no side effects - so it is trivially
 * unit-testable and shared by the page, the bulk-actions bar and the tests.
 * The deep-link URL itself is built by `buildSelectionSetBimLink`
 * (`clashBimLink.ts`) so the `isolate` / `focus` contract lives in one place.
