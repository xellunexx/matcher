// Portal magic-link landing resolution.
//
// A portal invite can carry an explicit `redirect_path` (the inviter chose
// exactly where the user should land). When it does not, we pick a default
// landing by role: subcontractors and suppliers run their work through the
// payment portal, so they default to /portal/payments; everyone else (client,
// investor, consultant, building_user) defaults to the generic role-aware
// /portal/home. Before this, the magic URL was hard-coded to /portal/payments
// for ALL roles, so a client landed on the subcontractor payment portal.

 * The URL ALWAYS targets the role's consume-capable landing (`/portal/home` or
 * `/portal/payments`), never the inviter's `redirect_path`. Only those two
 * landings consume the one-time token via POST /portal/auth/consume; pointing
 * the link at an arbitrary deep path (e.g. `/files`) would land the user there
 * unauthenticated and bounce them to /login. The `redirect_path` is stored with
 * the invite server-side and returned by the consume response, so the landing
 * page forwards the now-signed-in user to it (see `resolveLandingPath`).
 *
 * `origin` is the admin's current origin (the backend cannot know the public
 * origin behind a reverse proxy, so the inviter's origin is the correct base
 * for a self-hosted deployment). The token is carried in the query string.
