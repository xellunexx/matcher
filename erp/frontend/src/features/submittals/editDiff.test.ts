// The submittal edit form carried two defects that compound each other.
//
// It PATCHed every field on every save, so correcting a spec section also
// rewrote the description as it stood when the list was last read, undoing
// anyone else's edit to it without a word.
//
// And it mapped an emptied field to `undefined`, which JSON.stringify drops
// from the body entirely. Clearing the description or the date therefore did
// nothing at all: the value came straight back on the next read. The date is
// the sharper case, because the backend field sits behind a
// `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` pattern, so '' would not have worked either. Only
// `null` clears it.
//
// These tests hold the payload builder to both: untouched fields stay out of
// the body, cleared fields go in with a value the wire can actually carry.
