/**
 * Linear undo/redo stack for DWG takeoff annotation mutations.
 *
 * Each entry captures enough information to reverse the mutation:
 *   - ``create`` → undo deletes the persisted annotation
 *   - ``delete`` → undo re-creates from the captured snapshot
 *   - ``edit``   → undo patches back to ``before``; redo applies ``after``
 *
 * Kept framework-agnostic (plain TS) so the reducer is trivially testable.
 * Execution of each undo/redo entry is delegated to the caller via the
 * handler object it passes to ``apply``. The reducer itself only tracks
 * the entries and cursors.
 *
 * Standard linear behaviour: pushing a new entry after undoing wipes the
 * redo tail — but see task note: we are told standard linear-undo is
 * fine. We DO wipe redo on new pushes (that's standard), but we don't
 * wipe redo when branching is what the user wants to preserve.
 *
 * Capacity is bounded to ``MAX_STACK`` (50 by spec); oldest entries drop
 * off the tail when we exceed it.

 *  ``geometry.points``) which arrives via the create-annotation mutation's
 *  ``onSuccess`` handler. Treating one shape as the other blew up the undo
 *  stack with ``Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`` on
 *  every successful mutation — and because the crash happens inside a
 *  ``setUndoState`` callback on render, ANY subsequent re-render (e.g.
 *  clicking Snap, switching tools) re-entered the same state update and
 *  re-threw, making every tool appear to crash.
 *
 *  We now read both shapes and normalise, so the snapshot survives
 *  regardless of which field naming the input uses. Kept defensive about
 *  ``points`` being missing entirely (legacy rows / truncated responses) —
 *  we fall back to an empty array rather than crashing, since an empty
 *  snapshot is still a valid undo-placeholder. */
