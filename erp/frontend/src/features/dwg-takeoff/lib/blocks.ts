 * Block definitions: grouping them off the wire, and placing them in the world.

 * The wire is a flat list. An entity carries either `layout` (it is placed on a
 * sheet) or `block` (it is a member of a definition), never both. A definition
 * member's coordinates are in the block's own space and mean nothing until an
 * INSERT places them, which is why nothing here may go straight to the canvas.
 *
 * `expandBlockReferences` turns each INSERT into placed copies of its
 * definition, in world coordinates, so the rest of the viewer needs no idea
 * blocks exist: the fit box, the culling, the layer filter and the text clamp
 * all work on the copies exactly as they work on ordinary geometry.
