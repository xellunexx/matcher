// Authored as a standalone per-module file under ./catalog/modules/*.ts; the
// index globs this folder eagerly, so no edit to moduleExplanations.ts is
// needed. Every string is an i18n key with its inline English default, read via
// t(key, { defaultValue }); the defaults are the source copy and translators
// fill the other locales later.
