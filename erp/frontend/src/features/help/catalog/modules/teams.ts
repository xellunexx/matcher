// How-it-works catalog - Teams (the Team & Plan panel in Settings).
// Hub card only: this is the Team & Plan tab on the Settings page, so the
// entry routes to the host /settings route. The actual member administration
// (invite, roles, per-module access, deactivate) lives in User Management,
// which has its own card at /users. See ../../types.ts for the shape and key
// convention.
