It turns a defect, delay or change that is another party's liability into a back-charge: a recoverable claim position naming the responsible party, the gross amount and the percent of it that is chargeable. The engine works out the chargeable amount, what has been recovered and what is still outstanding. A live ledger rolls the open items up by party and currency, and a recovery-rate panel shows how much of what you were entitled to you actually got back, split by how provable the responsible owner is.",
