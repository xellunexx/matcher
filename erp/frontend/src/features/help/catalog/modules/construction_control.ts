// This is the integrated acceptance-control module at /construction-control:
// one place that runs the five pillars of construction quality control over
// the active project (inspections against acceptance criteria, material and
// lab certificates, as-built tolerance with e-sign, hold and witness gates,
// and a regime-aware handover package). It is distinct from the standalone
// Inspections, QMS and Handover cards.
