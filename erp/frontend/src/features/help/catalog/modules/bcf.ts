// How-it-works catalog - BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) issue exchange card.
// See ../../types.ts for the ModuleExplanation shape + key convention, and
// ../coordination.ts for the sibling clash / federation / rules cards.
//
// BCF is an I/O capability rather than a standalone page. The interactive
// export / import controls live on the Clash Detection page (/clash); the
// Model Coordination dashboard (/coordination) only rolls up BCF activity
// counts. The card therefore hosts on /clash so the hub "Show me where"
// spotlight lands on the real Export BCF / Import BCF buttons.

Each issue travels as a topic that carries its status, a saved 3D viewpoint and a thread of comments, so whoever opens it sees the same problem from the same camera angle. From the Clash Detection page you export clashes to a .bcfzip to hand to a designer, then import their returned .bcfzip to fold the fixes back into the run, with topics matched to your existing clashes automatically. The Model Coordination dashboard rolls that BCF activity up next to your federations and clash results.',
