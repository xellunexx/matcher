// How-it-works catalog - Global search.
// Hub card only. Global search has two surfaces: a Ctrl+Shift+K modal
// that searches records by meaning across every module, and a routed
// file search page. The modal has no route, so "Open module" opens the
// routed file search page (/files/search); the "Show me where" spotlight
// targets the File Manager sidebar entry (/files) via spotlightRoute,
// because the sub-route has no sidebar link of its own. See ../../types.ts
// for the shape and key convention.
