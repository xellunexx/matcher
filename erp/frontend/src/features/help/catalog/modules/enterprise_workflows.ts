// Approval Routes tab. See ../../types.ts for the ModuleExplanation shape and
// the key convention. English defaults live inline; translators fill the
// other locales later. The glob aggregator in moduleExplanations.ts picks this
// file up automatically, so no edit there is needed.

      'Enterprise Workflows is the Approval Routes side of Governance, where a large organisation sets up how work gets signed off. You build reusable route templates, each tied to one record type and either global or scoped to a single project, as an ordered ladder of steps. Every step names who approves - a role or a specific person - and how many must agree, with an optional time limit. Once saved, the route runs automatically whenever a matching record needs approval, so the right people sign off in the right order every time, with out-of-office cover and a live view of everything in flight.',
