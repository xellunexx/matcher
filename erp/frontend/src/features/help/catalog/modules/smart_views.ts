// How-it-works catalog - per-module gap-fill entry for Smart Views.
//
// Smart Views is a side-panel of the BIM viewer (BIMPage at /bim), so the
// card points at that host route: opening the module lands the user on the
// page that actually hosts the panel. See ../../types.ts for the shape and
// key convention, and ../coordination.ts for sibling coordination cards.
