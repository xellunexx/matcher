// The "Priced positions" KPI tile used to read a synthesized proxy: the
// dashboard collapsed every project's positions into a one-element array
// carrying a 0/1 flag, and the tile then counted that array as if it were
// the positions themselves. With one project holding 1 priced and 99
// unpriced positions the tile computed 1/1 and rendered 100 percent, in
// green - the opposite of the user's state, with a colour confirming it.
//
// The rollup already carries the real numbers (``position_count`` and
// ``positions_zero_price`` on ``boq_summary``), which is what the
// BOQSummaryWidget in components/NewWidgets.tsx has always used for its
// "Zero priced" figure. This is that arithmetic, lifted out so the tile
// and the widget cannot drift and so it can be tested without mounting a
// 2700-line page.

/** The two counts the tile needs, as the ``boq_summary`` rollup reports them. */

 * A percentage over a handful of positions is arithmetically true and

 * precision, and they say it at every size, which is why they are always
