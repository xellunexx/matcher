/**
 * RegionalPackCard — which regional pack is switched on, and what it did.
 *
 * A regional pack is the single largest piece of setup this product does on a
 * user's behalf: it loads a market's cost database, sets the currency, wires
 * the tax rules, turns on that market's validation standards and switches the
 * screens into that market's language. All of that used to be invisible after
 * the wizard closed. An estimator could work for weeks on top of SINAPI prices
 * and Brazilian ISS tax without a screen anywhere saying so, and an estimator
 * with NO pack had nothing telling them one existed.
 *
 * So the card answers three questions and nothing else: which pack is on, what
 * it set up, and - when none is on - what one would do and where to get it.
 *
 * The rows deliberately name what an estimator recognises. Not "cwicr_regions"
 * and "validation_rule_sets" but price databases and standards checked, with
 * the number beside them where a number is honest. The pack's own module ids
 * never reach the screen.
