/**
 * Pure roll-up of a BCF topic list into review-dashboard statistics.
 *
 * A coordination reviewer wants the shape of the issue backlog at a glance:
 * how many are open, how they split by status / priority / assignee, how many
 * are overdue, and how stale the open ones are getting. This is computed
 * entirely from the already-loaded topic list - no extra endpoint - and kept
 * pure so it is trivially unit-testable and reused by both the on-screen
 * dashboard and the printable report.
