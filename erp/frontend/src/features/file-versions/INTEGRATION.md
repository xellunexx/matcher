# W1 — File Versioning Integration

Splice instructions for wiring the `file-versions` feature into the
existing file-manager UI. Do NOT modify the shared file-manager
files directly — paste these snippets in the marked locations.

## 1. `FilePreviewPane.tsx` — add the version dropdown above secondary actions

**File**: `frontend/src/features/file-manager/components/FilePreviewPane.tsx`

### Add the import (near the other lucide / local imports, around line 13)

```tsx
import { VersionDropdown } from '@/features/file-versions/VersionDropdown';
```

### Mount the dropdown above the secondary actions strip

The component currently renders a flex column of primary + secondary
buttons starting at the `<div className="flex flex-col gap-1.5">` block
(around line 185 — the block that begins with the "Primary action"
comment). Add the dropdown directly above the **Email link** button
(currently around line 246, just after the **Download** link):

Locate this block (around line 233–250):

```tsx
{row.download_url && (
  <a
    href={row.download_url}
    ...
  >
    <Download size={13} />
    {t('files.actions.download', { defaultValue: 'Download' })}
  </a>
)}
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => onEmail(row)}
  ...
>
  <Mail size={13} />
  {t('files.actions.email', { defaultValue: 'Email link' })}
</button>
```

Insert a one-line strip between the Download anchor and the Email
button:

```tsx
{row.download_url && (
  <a href={row.download_url} ...>
    <Download size={13} />
    {t('files.actions.download', { defaultValue: 'Download' })}
  </a>
)}

{/* W1 — version history. Renders ``<V## · Current>`` chip + drop-
    down with a "Make current" action for every superseded row in
    the chain. */}
<div className="flex items-center justify-between gap-2 px-1 py-1 border-y border-border-light/60">
  <span className="text-[10px] uppercase tracking-wider text-content-tertiary font-medium">
    {t('files.versions.section_label', { defaultValue: 'Versions' })}
  </span>
  <VersionDropdown fileId={row.id} kind={row.kind} />
</div>

<button type="button" onClick={() => onEmail(row)} ...>
  ...
</button>
```

## 2. Translation keys to merge

Add the following keys to every locale dictionary you ship (only
the English entries are listed; provide localized text for
non-English files when the rest of the page is translated).

```json
{
  "files": {
    "versions": {
      "section_label": "Versions",
      "current": "Current",
      "superseded": "Superseded",
      "no_history": "No history",
      "load_failed": "Versions unavailable",
      "make_current": "Make current",
      "make_current_title": "Promote this version to current",
      "dropdown_aria": "File version history",
      "restored_title": "Restored to V{{n}}",
      "restore_failed": "Could not restore version"
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Backend wiring (no UI changes needed)

Partly done, as of 2026-08-27. This section used to say that no
module wrote version rows yet and that the dropdown would populate
once one started. Two modules do now, so read the rest of it as a
list of what is left rather than as a description of the present.

Writing today: the documents service, through
`_register_version_safely` at `documents/service.py:101` which four
upload paths call, and again on the revision route at `:831`; and
the CDE service at `cde/service.py:645`, when a document is linked
into a container.

Still to do: photos, sheets, BIM, DWG, takeoff, report and markup
call nothing, so files of those kinds have no chain at all and
their version surfaces stay empty. Each needs a
`FileVersionService.register_new_version(...)` call after a
successful upload. Copy the shape from `_register_version_safely`
rather than the bare snippet below: it puts the call inside a
SAVEPOINT, because a failed flush leaves the session unusable and
catching the error does not revive it, so without one a
best-effort registration takes down the rest of the upload path.

The service is importable directly:

```python
from app.modules.file_versions.service import FileVersionService
from app.modules.file_versions.schemas import FileVersionCreate

svc = FileVersionService(session)
await svc.register_new_version(
    FileVersionCreate(
        project_id=project_id,
        file_kind="document",
        file_id=str(doc.id),
        canonical_name=doc.name,
        notes=request_note,
        file_size=doc.file_size,
        checksum=sha256_hex,
    ),
    uploaded_by_id=user_uuid,
)
```
