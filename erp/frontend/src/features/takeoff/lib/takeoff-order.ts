 * to the front was to delete and redraw it. These helpers give a measurement an
 * optional explicit ``order`` key that drives the paint order everywhere it
 * matters - the canvas paint pass, the click hit-test precedence, the sidebar
 * list and the PDF export - so a bring-to-front / send-to-back stays consistent
 * across all four surfaces and survives a reload (the key round-trips via the
 * measurement metadata blob, so no schema change is needed).
 *
 * A measurement the user never reordered carries no ``order``; it then falls
 * back to its position in the array (creation order, the stable #375 baseline),
 * so existing measurements are painted exactly as before.

 * SAME slot halve that gap each time, and float64 runs out: measured against
 * this module, three rows with no explicit keys take 53 drops before the
 * midpoint comes back equal to the target's own key, and 55 before the no-op
 * guard reads a real drop as a no-op and nothing moves at all. The keys live in
 * the measurement metadata, so the count accumulates across sessions instead of
 * needing one long sitting, and nothing renumbers them: ``reorderGroups``
 * renumbers group bands, never measurement keys.
 *
 * Once two rows hold the same key {@link sortByPaintOrder} breaks the tie on
 * array position. That is stable and survives a reload, but it is not the slot
 * the row was released into, and the same wrong projection is what the annotated
 * PDF, the spreadsheet exports and the BOQ ordinals all read.
 *
 * So the midpoint is checked rather than trusted. When it lands where it was
 * promised the plan is the single-row write the drag has always been. When it
 * does not, the whole of the target's group is renumbered to consecutive
 * integers in the order the user actually asked for, which reopens unit-wide
 * gaps and puts the row where it was dropped. The slow path is paid only on the
 * drop that would otherwise fail.
 *
 * Three details are forced by existing behaviour rather than chosen:
 *
 * - The renumber spans the group across the WHOLE array, not the current page,
 *   for the reason {@link sortByPaintOrder} already implies: the projection is
 *   per document, so renumbering a page would strand the group's rows on other
 *   pages against freshly numbered neighbours.
 * - Every row in the group is given an explicit key, including rows that never
 *   carried one. Leaving those on the ``order ?? index`` fallback would sort
 *   them against the new integers by array position, which is not where they
 *   are on screen.
 * - The dragged row is numbered along with the rest, since it is excluded from
 *   its own neighbour search and would otherwise keep its stale key.
 *
 * Returns ``null`` when the target is missing or the drop changes nothing: the
 * dragged row already holds the key AND the group, or, on the renumber path,
 * the group is already in the requested order.
