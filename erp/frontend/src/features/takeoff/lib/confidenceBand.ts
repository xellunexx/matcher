/** Turn a detector's confidence into the band a reviewer can act on.
 *
 *  The takeoff viewer used to print the raw number ("62%") next to every AI
 *  suggestion. A percentage is not a decision: an estimator has no way to know
 *  whether 62 is good, and the number reads as precision the detector does not
 *  have. The server already publishes the two cut points it uses itself
 *  (``/plan-read/meta``), so the same suggestion is described the same way on
 *  both sides.
 *
 *  The thresholds are always passed in. Hardcoding them here is what this
 *  module exists to prevent: they are configurable per deployment
 *  (``MATCH_CONFIDENCE_HIGH`` / ``MATCH_CONFIDENCE_MEDIUM``), and a UI that
 *  disagrees with the server about where "high" starts is worse than one that
 *  shows no band at all.
