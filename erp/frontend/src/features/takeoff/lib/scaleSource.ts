/**
 * Attribute a measurement's scale ratio to where it came from.
 *
 * A wrong scale is the one takeoff error that multiplies through every
 * quantity on a sheet. The server stores a ``scale_source`` per measurement so
 * a sheet found to be mis-scaled can be narrowed to the rows that actually
 * inherited the bad ratio, instead of sending the whole document back to be
 * re-checked by hand. Only the drawing surface knows which of the client-side
 * sources applies, so the client has to state it; the server never guesses.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to enforce is that we state a source only when
 * we know one. A provenance field that is sometimes a guess is worse than no
 * field at all, because it is precisely the field a re-scale would trust when
 * deciding which rows to recompute, and a laundered guess would quietly
 * exclude the rows that needed it most.
