/**
 * Default-label counter seeding (issue #384).
 *
 * New measurements get an auto label ("Distance 1", "Area 2", ...) from a
 * per-type counter that starts at 0 and increments on each draw. The counter is
 * reset to 0 on every load path (file upload, deep-link, clear-all) but was
 * never re-seeded from the measurements that hydrate afterwards, so a reopened
 * document recounted from 1 and produced a second "Distance 1" alongside the
 * one already on the sheet. Those labels flow into the BOQ export description,
 * where a duplicate is ambiguous.
 *
 * {@link seedAnnotationCounters} scans the hydrated measurements and returns,
 * per measurement type, the highest trailing integer already present in any
 * measurement's annotation / label. The caller raises its per-type counters to
 * these values (never lowering them), so the next auto label resumes above the
 * numbers already in use and can never collide with an existing one.
 *
 * It deliberately keys on the trailing number rather than the localized label
 * prefix, so it stays correct in every language and is robust to a user having
 * renamed a measurement to something ending in a number: over-counting only
 * skips a number (harmless), whereas under-counting would reduplicate.
