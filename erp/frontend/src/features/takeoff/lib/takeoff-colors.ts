/**
 * Group-colour reconciliation for the PDF takeoff viewer (issues #396/#397/#398).
 *
 * A group's custom colour lives in two places. `customGroupColors` is a map
 * keyed by group name; the same value is mirrored onto every measurement as
 * `groupColor` so the colour scheme round-trips to the server inside the
 * existing metadata blob without a schema change.
 *
 * The invariant these helpers exist to enforce:
 *
 *   The MAP is authoritative for every group it knows about. The copy mirrored
 *   onto a measurement is a cache of that map, never an input to it, except at
 *   one moment: hydration, which is how the map learns about a group in the
 *   first place.
 *
 * Before this module the two copies were kept in step by two standing effects,
 * one writing in each direction, each reading a snapshot the other had already
 * invalidated. When the two disagreed there was no fixed point: each write
 * republished the value it had read one render earlier, so the pair alternated
 * forever, kept every affected row permanently dirty (blocking the debounced
 * save) and wrote the inconsistent map back to localStorage, so a reload
 * resumed the loop instead of ending it.
 *
 * The direction is therefore one-way by construction here: {@link stampGroupColors}
 * is the only standing writer, {@link hydrateGroupColors} runs once per opened
 * document, and {@link groupColorCommit} owns the decision between the two so
 * the gate is testable rather than living inside a React effect.

 * The precedence - own override, then group, then base - is the other half of
 * the clearing story in #396: clearing an override is only meaningful because
 * something downstream falls back to the group, so the two have to be read
 * together or "clear" silently means "paint in the base blue". It was written
 * out by hand at every site that needed it, which is how an override could be
 * cleared in one place and still honoured in another.
 *
 * Absent and empty are both treated as "no override": the swatches store a hex
 * string and clearing stores nothing, so an empty string only ever arrives from
 * a malformed row, and treating it as a colour would paint that row invisible.

 * Fold the colours mirrored onto measurements back into the map.
 *
 * This is a LOAD-TIME step, not a standing invariant. A colour chosen on
 * another machine (or in an earlier session, on a browser whose localStorage
 * was cleared) reaches this client only inside each measurement's metadata, so
 * the map has to be taught it once when the rows arrive. Running it on every
 * change to the array is what made the mirror a second writer.
 *
 * The mirror wins over the map here, deliberately: at load the map is a local
 * cache (localStorage) while the mirror came off the server, so the mirror is
 * the copy other people can see. That also gives a document already stuck in
 * the inconsistent state a deterministic way out - it settles on the server's
 * value instead of resuming the alternation.
 *
 * Returns the SAME object when nothing changed, so a caller can use reference
 * equality to skip a re-render.

 * before {@link hydrateGroupColors} had a chance to read it - for instance when
 * rows resolve from the server after the user has already drawn something, so
 * the document is marked hydrated before those rows exist. Leaving it costs one
