/**
 * Which BOQ positions can show resource sub-rows, and whether they all are.
 *
 * Backs the toolbar's show/hide-all-resources toggle. The point of extracting
 * it is that the answer MUST agree with the per-row chevron: expand-all has to
 * open exactly the rows that render a chevron, or the toggle reports "all
 * expanded" while rows sit closed, or it opens rows that offer no way back.
 *
 * So the predicate here is deliberately the chevron's own, from
 * ``ExpandCellRenderer``: a non-section position whose ``metadata.resources``
 * is a non-empty array. Note in particular that this is NOT
 * :func:`hasContributingResources` - that one asks whether resources carry
 * quantity and drives PRICING. A position whose resources are all blank still
 * gets a chevron, because the user has to be able to open it and type the
 * quantities in. Swapping the two predicates would hide exactly the rows that
 * need attention most.
 *
 * Lives in its own module rather than in ``boqHelpers`` because it needs
 * ``isSection`` from ``./api``, and ``api.ts`` already imports ``boqHelpers``.
