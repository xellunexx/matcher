/**
 * Restore a saved BCF viewpoint back INTO the live 3D scene - the inverse of
 * the capture bridge (bcfBridge.ts / useBcfCapture.ts).
 *
 * "Navigate to issue": given a persisted {@link Viewpoint}, fly the camera to
 * exactly where the issue was raised and mark the elements it was raised
 * against, so a reviewer can jump from the issue list straight to what is
 * flagged in the model. This is the core of a coordination-review workflow.
 *
 * Two facts about our captured viewpoints shape the maths here:
 *  - the stored camera direction is a UNIT vector, so the orbit target
 *    (focal distance) is not recorded and must be reconstructed - we project
 *    the model's content-bounds centre onto the view ray. The camera
 *    orientation (position + direction + up) already fixes the rendered image
 *    exactly; only the pivot depth is inferred, which is visually harmless.
 *  - viewpoints store `element_stable_ids` (IFC GlobalId / RVT UniqueId /
 *    mesh ref), but the scene managers key on the internal element id, so the
 *    caller passes a `stableIdToElementId` resolver. Visibility restore is
 *    therefore best-effort (a mesh may not carry a stable id); the camera
 *    restore is always reliable.
