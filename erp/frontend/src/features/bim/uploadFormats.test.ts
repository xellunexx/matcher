/**
 * Standing guard: the BIM upload screen states one format list.
 *
 * A user reported that .dae and .3ds were "no longer visible" and read it as a
 * regression. Nothing had been removed - the badge row showed six of fifteen
 * accepted extensions behind a "+ more" span with no handler. Seven
 * hand-maintained lists lived on that screen and no two named the same set.
 *
 * These tests deliberately do NOT re-type the list. An assertion like
 * ``expect(exts).toEqual(['.rvt', ...])`` would just be list number eight: it
 * would go stale the same way, and it would pass while the screen lied. They
 * assert relationships instead - that the picker, the badge rows and the
 * routing predicate all derive from the same array.
