/**
 * One list of what the BIM Hub upload accepts, and what happens to each format.
 *
 * This screen used to carry seven hand-maintained lists - two badge rows, two
 * size hints, two aria-labels and a rejection toast - and no two of them named
 * the same set. A user reported that alternative 3D formats such as .dae and
 * .3ds were "no longer visible"; nothing had been removed, the badge row simply
 * showed six of the fifteen accepted extensions behind a "+ more" chip that was
 * a plain span with nothing behind it. A capability the user cannot find is
 * indistinguishable from one we deleted.
 *
 * So the extensions live here once and every consumer derives from them: the
 * ``accept`` attributes, the badge rows, and the format names interpolated into
 * the translated strings. Extensions are not translatable, which is the point -
 * deriving the badges costs no locale work, while enumerating formats inside
 * prose is exactly how seven lists happened.
 *
 * The tier is carried alongside the extension because it is real information a
 * flat list would throw away: .ifc gives full properties and quantities, .stl
 * gives triangles, and .dwg is not imported here at all. The badge colour and
 * the explanatory note both read the tier rather than restating it.

/**
 * What the upload does with a format.
 *
 * - ``bim``     native BIM, converted server-side with properties, quantities
 *               and classifications intact.
 * - ``mesh``    geometry only, parsed in-browser by the mesh importer. You can
 *               view and measure it; there is no BIM data to carry.
 * - ``handoff`` accepted by the picker, then routed to another module. Not a
 *               BIM Hub import at all, which is why it does not share the
 *               ``bim`` treatment even though the old badge row implied it did.
