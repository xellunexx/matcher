// Inside track - supporter access gate.
//
// There is no payment integration yet, so the perk (early-look access to the
// Inside track panel) is unlocked with a plain supporter access code instead
// of a paid account flag. After someone donates they are handed a code by
// hand; entering it here flips a localStorage flag that this hook reads on
// every load. This is intentionally simple - the panel never gates the app's
// code or data, only a small news-and-roadmap page, so a shared or leaked
// code costs us nothing beyond an extra reader.
