/**
 * Resolve a safe post-login redirect target from a URL query string.
 *
 * A guarded route sends a signed-out visitor to `/login?next=/where/they/wanted`
 * (see RequireAuth). After a successful sign-in we want to send them on to that
 * path, but only when it is a genuine internal, non-auth destination. Anything
 * else - missing, external, protocol-relative, or an auth route that would
 * dead-end or loop - falls back to `/`, which the app resolves to the dashboard.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for that decision so the login form and
 * the already-authenticated route guards cannot disagree. When `setTokens`
 * flips the auth state a tick before the form's own `navigate(next)` runs, the
 * `/login` guard re-renders and redirects too; if the guard hard-coded `/` it
 * won that race and silently dropped the `next`. That was the demo deep-link
 * bug: every case-study "open in the demo" link landed on the dashboard instead
 * of its module. With both the form and the guard routing through this helper,
 * whichever navigation wins lands on the same validated place.
 *
 * @param search - a location search string, with or without the leading `?`.

 * `http://evil.example.com/`. Verified in a browser, along with `/\\host` and
