/**
 * Global reporting for queries that fail with nothing left to show.
 *
 * A screen that reads `data ?? []` renders the same empty table whether the
 * list came back empty or the request never came back at all. Mutations have
 * had a global error handler from the start; queries had none, so a backend
 * that is down reads as a project with no data in it, and the user acts on an
 * answer nobody gave them.
 *
 * This handler is deliberately quiet. It reports one case, the server failing
 * to answer while the screen has nothing on it, and stays out of the way
 * everywhere else. Everything it stays out of the way of is listed below with
 * the reason, because the tempting change here is always to report more.
