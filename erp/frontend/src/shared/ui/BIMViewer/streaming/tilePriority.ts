 * Streaming tile ordering.
 *
 * The streamer downloads and reveals tiles in whatever order the manifest lists
 * them, which is spatial-octree order, not importance order. On the initial load
 * there is no meaningful camera yet (the view fits to the model only after it
 * arrives), so we cannot sort by what the user is looking at. We order by
 * geometry density instead: meshes carried per byte transferred, richest first.
 *
 * Why density and not raw geometry mass. Ranking by node_count alone maximises
 * how much of the building each *tile* carries, but a tile is only on screen
 * once it has finished downloading, so what the user actually experiences is
 * geometry per second, i.e. geometry per byte. Those are very different orders
 * on a real building, because tile payloads are wildly skewed: on the reference
 * tileset in `__fixtures__/largeTileset.ts` (25 516 meshes, 80 tiles, 204 MB)
 * they run from 1.5 KB to 17 MB. Measured on that tileset, with the streamer's
 * default concurrency of 6:
 *
 *                    bytes before      share of the model drawn after
 *                    the first tile    10 MB    50 MB    100 MB
 *   node_count desc      5.2 MB          3.9%    27.6%    47.1%
 *   density desc         1.5 KB         11.1%    40.2%    67.5%
 *
 * Density dominates at every point on the curve, which is not luck: ordering by
 * value per unit cost is the greedy optimum for "most geometry for the bytes
 * spent so far". Ranking by mass instead put ~37.9 MB of tiles in flight before
 * anything at all could appear.
 *
 * Ties fall back to geometry mass, then ground-up, then manifest order.
 *
 * NOTE that this changes how the load *looks*, not only how fast it is. Under
 * the previous mass ordering the ground-up rule broke ties often enough that a
 * building visibly rose from its base. Density ties are rare (two tiles must
 * carry the same meshes per byte), so ground-up now almost never fires and the
 * character is closer to "simple elements land first, intricate ones last".
 * That is a deliberate trade of a nice-looking assembly for a much earlier
 * first paint, and it is the thing to watch on the next on-device pass.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic (no camera, no THREE, no DOM): input tiles in, a new
 * ordered array out. The manifest already carries the per-tile node_count /
 * byte_size / center the backend tiler bakes, so this reads for free.
