/**
 * Yield control to the event loop between tile parses so input and rendering
 * stay responsive while a model streams in.
 *
 * Prefers the Scheduler API's `scheduler.yield()` where the browser provides it
 * (current Chromium, our site target): it hands control back to the browser for
 * input and paint and then resumes THIS streaming task at a raised priority. A
 * plain `setTimeout(0)` also yields, but the browser clamps nested timeouts to
 * ~4 ms, and that clamp is dead time between parses that stretches a many-tile
 * stream for no benefit. `scheduler.yield()` keeps the same responsiveness
 * without paying it. Everywhere the API is missing we fall back to `setTimeout`,
 * which is universal and behaves exactly as the loader did before, so there is
 * no regression on older engines.
