/**
 * Persistent IndexedDB cache for geometry tiles.
 *
 * Tiles are content-addressed (the URL is the sha256 of the bytes), so they
 * are immutable and safe to cache forever. This is the persistence the
 * monolithic GLB path can never have (it is served no-store because its node
 * names can be re-patched): a revisit - or a job-site tablet that went
 * offline - reads tiles straight from disk instead of re-downloading the
 * whole model.
 *
 * Every operation degrades gracefully: if IndexedDB is unavailable (private
 * mode, SSR, a quota error), reads return null and writes are no-ops, so the
 * streaming loader simply falls back to the network.
