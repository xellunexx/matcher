/**
 * Accelerated picking for the BIM viewer.
 *
 * A click or hover in the viewer raycasts the whole scene. Without an
 * acceleration structure every ray tests every triangle of every mesh, which
 * on a real model (hundreds of meshes, each thousands of triangles) is the
 * dominant cost of selecting or hovering an element. three-mesh-bvh builds a
 * bounding-volume hierarchy per geometry so a ray descends a handful of nodes
 * instead of scanning all triangles.
 *
 * The patch is behaviour-preserving. `acceleratedRaycast` consults the BVH
 * only when the geometry actually has a `boundsTree`; otherwise it delegates
 * to the stock `Mesh.raycast` it captured at import time. Meshes with no
 * bounds tree (placeholder boxes, helpers, highlight outlines) raycast exactly
 * as before. We patch only `Mesh.prototype.raycast`, never
 * `BatchedMesh.prototype.raycast`, so the big-model BatchedMesh path and its
 * `batchHandle` -> elementId resolution are untouched.
 *
 * Element identity is untouched: the BVH changes only WHICH triangles a ray
 * tests, never the object it belongs to, so SelectionManager's
 * node-name -> element-id match keeps resolving the same id.
