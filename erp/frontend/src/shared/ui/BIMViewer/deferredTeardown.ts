/**
 * DeferredTeardown - a one-shot, cancelable teardown timer that lets the BIM
 * viewers survive React's development double-mount (and any other
 * unmount-then-immediately-remount) without disposing a healthy WebGL scene.
 *
 * React 18 StrictMode mounts an effect, runs its cleanup, then mounts it
 * again, synchronously, within the same task. A viewer whose cleanup disposes
 * the WebGL context on the spot therefore force-loses the context and rebuilds
 * on the very next line. To the user that reads as a black canvas / "WebGL
 * unavailable", and it desyncs any "already loaded this model" bookkeeping so
 * the second, empty scene renders nothing.
 *
 * The fix is to DEFER the teardown by one task instead of running it inline:
 *   - the effect cleanup calls schedule(dispose); the dispose runs next task;
 *   - a remount that happens first calls cancel(); the dispose never runs and
 *     the caller reuses its live scene.
 * A genuine unmount has no matching remount, so the timer fires and the scene
 * is disposed for real, exactly one task later - imperceptible, and safe on a
 * canvas React has already detached.
 *
 * The scheduler and canceller are injectable so the behaviour can be
 * unit-tested deterministically, without real timers or a DOM.
