/**
 * useBIMGeometryCache — in-memory LRU cache of geometry blobs keyed by modelId.
 *
 * Purpose: navigating away from /bim/{id} and back used to re-download the
 * geometry from scratch every time, even though the underlying file hadn't
 * changed (RFC 19 §UX-1). This store keeps a small LRU of recently-loaded
 * geometry blobs in memory so the second mount can parse them locally and
 * skip the network round-trip + progress bar entirely.
 *
 * Storage: in-memory only — geometry blobs routinely run 50–150 MB and
 * localStorage's 5–10 MB quota would never hold them. The cache is lost
 * on page reload, which is fine: a hard refresh is a strong signal that
 * the user wants a fresh fetch.
 *
 * Eviction: capped at MAX_ENTRIES models *and* MAX_TOTAL_BYTES total. When
 * either ceiling is exceeded the oldest entry by `cachedAt` is evicted
 * until both invariants hold again.
